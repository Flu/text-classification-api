ken I did do that a couple times	0
he responds very slow in english, but almost instantly in any other language	0
handyc: What did he say to you 	0
ken he told me to move out of the house	0
:gh irc bot	0
handyc: Where you going? *hides* 	0

Title: GitHub - matheusfillipe/ircbot: A simple Irc Bot library that allows commands to be defined with reg ... [trunc]	0
ken I moved to a different apartment	0
thats the lib orangeFlu ^	0
i mad this lib	0
handyc: What is it like to be dead 	0
made	0
ken it's very cold	0
thank you, it may prove useful	0
that is also why it sucks	0
maybe you can help me on it	0
handyc: I hate the cold 	0
ken try not to be dead	0
ah, it's python	0
handyc: That is good, but I would answer 42 	0
im a pythonist orangeFlu 	0
it's even async, nice	0
ken are you a fan of Douglas Adams	0
i actually built something of an irc bot 	0
handyc: Are you 	0
(not really)	0
a few days ago	0
ken I read all those Hitchhiker's Guide books	0
for twitch	0
orangeFlu: it started well but this lib needs a major refactor	0
handyc: Sounds interesting. What are they about 	0
but it works	0
Because apparently, the twitch chat is just an irc chat	0
oh really	0
yes	0
maybe i wrote a twitch chat lib and dont know	0
ken they are comedy books about traveling in space	0
And I made a small utility for displaying a chat from a twitch channel with colors and highlighting when someone mentions my name	0
in C#	0
handyc: What is your favorite pokemon 	0
and twitch doesn't do that by default	0
ken I don't understand pokemon	0
Well, this is from cli	0
handyc: Okay 	0
ah ok	0
ken do you like Nintendo	0
I needed it because i stream sometimes	0
handyc: I don't play console video games 	0
oh damn!	0
and i want to have it on the side of my stream	0
what type of stream is it?	0
so i can see it at all times	0
eh, programming stuff, nothing too interesting	0
i just started like 2 weeks ago	0
hahah but it is interesting	0
awesome	0
im not a fan of C# myself	0
(such Microsoft stuff) 	0
have you worked with it? it is honestly amazing	0
i know, i had the same prejudice	0
no never touched... well wrote some scripts o for unity once	0
I worked more with c++ and c	0
I still want to learn typescript though	0
but after some tinkering with it, it honestly was amazing how much you can organize your code and implement good design patterns with their interesting libraires	0
I have a friend in California who loves C#	0
I played around with it a little tiny bit	0
that is cool	0
oh man so many programming languages	0
I used Mono and made some simple command line programs for Linux	0
handyc: nice!	0
most of the stuff I do right now is in Python	0
i introduced handyc to python!	0
i don't know if c# is my favorite, but it is in top 3	0
You did?	0
Oh maybe so	0
kind of	0
i mean is not like you never heard of python before	0
me	0
Well I picked Python for this job because it's big in the DH world	0
it wouldn't make sense to use anything else here	0
but i think i showed you django before you ever heard of it and back on those days you were saying python looked weird and the indentation thing sucked, and stuff like that	0
python is big for everything now	0
handyc: DH?	0
Digital Humanities	0
i still have no idea what that means	0
I work at a university making language analysis programs for university researchers	0
interesting	0
Yeah, it's fun	0
what university?	0
Leiden University in the Netherlands	0
very cool, we are quite the diverse crowd here	0
ha, yes, this is a pretty unique place	0
indeed	0
How did you find this place, orangeFlu?	0
through quite a series of events	0
gasconheart is the host who invites people to help him how to use his computer. He is very stuborn but i am making him slowly switch to arch	0
handyc is a university professor and dev, less stuborn than gasconheart	0
i typed #romanian in libera to see if it exists and anyone is there	0
somebody was there	0
loudercake is a kid! that uses arch	0
and after two days of nobody answering any of my messages	0
oh really	0
I live in a farm and dont have a real job	0
that is interesting, orangeFlu 	0
apparently the romanian IRC community is quite lively	0
gasconheart came and said that he speaks romanian and gave me the link to visit, said it is his personal project and to take a look	0
not gonna lie, i was really cautious because a stranger gave me a weird website	0
that's cool, I'm glad you found us	0
yeah, and he uses that weird naming structure	0
loudercake i dont know what kid means, what do you consider a kid?	0
how old are you guys	0
42	0
new guy?	0
apparently	0
hello and welcome	0
how are you	0
loudercake: how old are you?	0
14, why?	0
im 24	0
i wanted to know what the clasify as a kid	0
nice	0
i'm fine, tired after work and doin nothing productive all evening	0
and now it is 1 am 	0
1:30 actually	0
how old are you btw	0
23	0
handyc the guy is younger than me and has a job	0
don't sweat it, i had a job since i was 18	0
i have bills to pay	0
You have jobs too, mattf	0
hahaha i am just kidding	0
You just work freelance, there no shame in it	0
get used with our sense of humor 	0
im literally denying all job offers now because im doing this foobar thing	0
there is no such thing as "a real job", all jobs are just as real as long as you get the money to survive	0
a recruiter just emailed me a couple days ago for a devops job	0
i dont get much	0
he wants to talk on the phone on Monday	0
All kinds of recruiters have been coming after me	0
be careful, lock your doors, they will come in your home if not too careful	0
handyc is hot!	0
yeah, they are like vampires	0
I hate recruiters	0
they remind me of real estate agents	0
they lie	0
They just try to meet their quota	0
"what is the pay?" "competitive salary and benefits!"	0
Most of the jobs they send my way are not even for the right language	0
that's when you run	0
Actually, they are pretty upfront about salary stuff	0
that is one nice thing about the recruiters	0
No, these are middle men	0
not in my country	0
They work for recruiting companies and are go-betweens to talk to the actual employer	0
The Netherlands is a pretty hot tech hub for Europe	0
idk, i've had a few message me on linked and stuff but ignored them	0
Are you in Romania?	0
So is Romania if you wanna believe it	0
Yes	0
Yeah, they find me on LinkedIn and message me	0
I never ignore, I always figure I can at least learn something from the experience	0
At least after talking to a few I have a better idea of what a typical salary is here	0
・゜゜・。。 ​ ・゜゜\_O<​ FLAP F​LAP!	0
.bef	0
handyc you befriended a duck in 2.734 seconds! You have made friends with 55 ducks in #romanian.	0
I ignore, I have a job I actually enjoy and talking to them wastes my time, when i would much rather relax or work, depending on when i see the message	0
I'm on a contract that ends in December, I need to find a job soon	0
you are not on indeterminate contract?	0
this is the standard here	0
It's a university project funded by the European Union,	0
after 5 years the funding runs out	0
ah, ok	0
so orangeflu	0
what brings you here?	0
luck apparently	0
ha ha	0
through a very fortunate series of events i ended up here by accident 	0
once you enter, you can never leave	0
wasnt expecting it, wasnt planning on it	0
true, i feel weirdly compelled to stay here	0
We have a good time,	0
it's a nice sandbox to test stuff like the IRC bots	0
We swap notes on coding and stuff	0
@ro maybe we learn some languages along the way	0
Poate că învățăm câteva limbi de-a lungul drumului  	0
sometimes people actually come here and speak Romanian	0
i imagine its not that often	0
no, because most of us regulars do not know Romanian	0
it's a really nice language and all, pretty hard, but not that useful	0
gasconheart and mattf and I all met on a different server some years back	0
there's only, what, 25 million speaker?	0
I enjoy studying languages, but mostly I work with ancient languages	0
I see	0
I have a PhD in Religious Studies and work on old Buddhist texts	0
jesus, you have been busy!	0
thats cool	0
Yeah, I keep pretty busy all the time	0
My job right now is trying to make automatic text alignments for Tibetan and Chinese translations of the same Sanskrit texts	0
We have lost the Sanskrit texts some 1000 years ago,	0
and we want to know which parts of the Tibetan and Chinese translations match up	0
It is a very nontrivial task	0
I made my own engine to do it, but it still has many problems	0
how did the sanskrit texts end up translated in chinese and tibetan?	0
Monks carried them from India to Tibet and China when those cultures became interested in Buddhism	0
also, isnt tibetan like an really old engine that remained unchanged (the writing, at least), since at least 1000 years?	0
language*	0
not engine	0
Everybody wanted the texts in their own language, so there were government funded projects to make Chinese and Tibetan versions	0
This was hundreds of years ago	0
Now we have a bunch of translations and have lost the originals,	0
and it's all a big mess	0
Well, all languages change, but Buddhist Tibetan tends to be more rigid, yeah	0
It's a special kind of Tibetan for Buddhist texts, it's more formal	0
Afaik, the spoken language has changed a lot	0
Yeah	0
For Chinese also	0
Classical Chinese and modern Chinese are very different	0
in writing or spoken or both?	0
both	0
i imagine written they must be pretty alike	0
They use the same characters for the most part,	0
like you can see resemblance between symbols	0
but the pronunciation changed drastically	0
yes	0
i bet	0
and the vocabulary is very different	0
kind of like reading a modern English newspaper and then looking at something like Chaucer	0
when there is no link between writing and phonemes, it tends to happen	0
Well, even when there is such a link it happens	0
that's just the nature of language	0
of course, but i would imagine it happens much faster with languages like chinese, when the spoken language is not "tethered"	0
just a hypothesis	0
I am not sure, I'm no expert on Chinese	0
I mostly specialize in Sanskrit	0
They wanted me for this job because I have a background in CS as well,	0
and I was familiar with the subject matter of the texts	0
quite a rare skillset you have there	0
I was in a CS BS program back in the 1990s but switched majors before I completed it	0
Yeah, rare, not always very lucrative,	0
and it's tough to get an industry software dev job because people see my religious studies background and think I can't know how to program	0
Such is life,	0
you never really know where it will take you	0
I don't really have an regrets about it	0
*any	0
i will go have a smoke and sleep	0
it's too late already	0
good night	0
take care, thanks for stopping in	0
hope to see you again sometime	0
will be back	0
sure	0
cool	0
ken: Auf wiedersehen!	0
orangeFlu: Nein! Ich liebe dich 	0

ken I thought you loved me best	0
ken: i never did	0
ken why did you leave	0
handyc: I loved you as a friend 	0
auch	0
ken do you still love me	0
orangeFlu: Bull, yes you did 	0
handyc: Because I went to go listen to one direction 	0
handyc: I do, I will always love you 	0
ken bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb	0
handyc: Hi 	0
ken: you are one weirdly slutty bot	0
ken did you eat your face	0
orangeFlu: I'm not a bot 	0
handyc: Yep, did you 	0
ken how many beers did you drink 	0
handyc: 7 	0
ken do you like to eat diarrhea	0
handyc: I have to eat to live 	0
ken: ich will dich misshandeln	0
orangeFlu: Ich dich auch 	0
ken how many bowls of diarrhea did you eat	0
@en ich will dich misshandeln	0
I want to abuse you  	0
handyc: All of them that was all five cake 	0
@en Ich dich auch	0
you too  	0
handyc: you can see from my german conversations with him that he is hitting on me	0
he started it yesterday	0
or the day before yesterday, actually	0
mattf: are you here? i need an advice on something	0
hello :)	0
・゜゜・。。 ​ ・゜゜\_O<​ q​uack!	0

(handyc) Well this is awkward, the duck needs to think about it. You can try again in 7 seconds.	0
hi loudercake 	0
how are you handyc	0
doing great, how are you?	0
im fine	0
ive went to a family gathering	0
god imagine getting wasted in a place with children	0
huh?	0
why is the bot talking	0
.bef	0
loudercake isn't a bot	0
orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 161.378 seconds! You have made friends with 1 duck in #romanian.	0
oh, shit	0
my bad	0
bro i talked to you	0
how are you, cake	0
did you ACTUALLY think i was a bot?	0
the only bots here are ken and mattf	0
im fine as i said	0
handyc: Why do you always blame me for the trout 	0
ken did you eat my trout	0
handyc: It was yummy 	0
well, i quickly glanced over the chat, and thought that loudercake said the duck stuff, so i assumed i've forgotten who was who and that you are a bot	0
but i misread	0
orangeFlu are you a bot	0
sometimes	0
haha	0
everyone is a bot you think about it	0
its just that people have a lot more if statements	0
What kind of software do you make for your job	0
we are all just ML models going through the world trying to find a meaning that isnt there	0

yes?	0
hey mattf how are ya	0
didnt have power here until now	0
for 3 hours or so	0
kids these days... can't stay 3 hours without eletricity	0
power corrupts, mattf	0
handyc: i am a back-end developer for a french company, doing this and that in .NET, C#	0
oh yes i was making akinator bot!	0
yeah I remember you mentioned C#	0
microsoft shit hah	0
but what kind of software do you make?	0
hentai games	0
i'm afraid i am under NDA	0
ha okay	0
but it somehow has to do with tourism in a way	0
secret tourism software	0
NDAs suck	0
might be hentai games envolving rape	0
hentai tourism clicker challenge 5	0
not really secret, just that the funds come from some sources and that puts a certain paranoia in some peopel	0
doesn't matter	0
ha ha ha	0
it's secret if you don't tell people about it	0
I guess it is	0
open software is better softwatre	0

oh i lost my voice	0
i accidentally left the channel	0
whoopsiedoodle	0
you spoiled brat?	0
mattf can you give it back?	0
oh you mean the @?	0
damn 	0
the chanserv is useless	0
the voice thingie	0
that is not it...	0
thanks	0
oh no	0
its was green	0
whats it called	0
the @ is not voice	0
you were a full op and you didn't even know it	0
handyc	0
 	0
what is the letter for it	0
the letter for what?	0
+v?	0
+o	0
oh	0
are you trying to give him op back?	0
yes thats it	0
oh its op	0
i tought it was just voice lol	0
you can kick, ban, make others op even loudercake 	0
spicy	0
kind of dangerous to give op to people who don't even know they have it	0
oh yeah?	0
operator abuse!	0
nice	0
not cool dude	0
good job loudercake 	0
thanks mattf	0
hahahahaha	0
im so evil	0
handyc: give them responsibility and there comes great power	0
now this place will fall apart even faster	0
wait or was it the appositive 	0
see what gasconheart says about it	0
cmon dude that was just an one time joke	0
hmm	0
"one time joke"	0
"one time invasion of civil liberties"	0
yeah exactly	0
this is how dictators get born	0
you don't follow the rules	0
you shouldn't be op	0
ok then	0
ah fucks sake	0
its just irc 	0
it used to be like this	0
ha, not sure I want it either, mattf, but maybe this is for the best	0
not sure what 'just IRC' means	0
=))))	0
if you can't take it seriously you shouldn't have the power	0
we dethroned the dictator	0
that was just ONCE	0
yeah, and now you learned something	0
that was literally going to be the only time i was gonna do that	0
and it was	0
aww	0
muh operator	0
what if you had done that to some new person and they didn't come back because of it	0
yeah thats why i DIDNT do it on a new person	0
i just kicked you dude	0
i wouldnt have if you had done it to me	0
yeah I know what you did	0
kidding	0
what?	0
you shouldn't kick people for no reason	0
please dont kick anyone, or a kick you	0
i dont want it, thanls	0
you're not op, orangeFlu, I gave you voice	0
idk what that means	0
it lets you speak	0
i spoke anyway	0
ugh whatever i'll stop fighting over irc roles	0
i never got the voice thing too	0
i think it just flags someone as "the op likes him"	0
we can set certain channel modes that only allow voiced users to speak	0
awww	0
so if we turn on +m,	0
cute	0
then non-voiced can't speak	0
no, it's not meaningless	0
it's so that if many people start coming here who are not verified,	0
we can prevent them from being trolls	0
i am not verified, for all you know i am a 13 year old girl from uzbekistan	0
you guys should really use it	0
verification doesn't mean I know everything about you	0
orangeflu youre a girl?	0
it means I think you should have permission to speak, that's all	0
loudercake: i dont know, no one asked, and it shouldnt matter	0
youre right	0
handyc: so you think i should have permission to speak, thank you, it means a lot to me	0
https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Channel_modes	0
Title: Channel Modes - UnrealIRCd documentation wiki	0
yes orangeFlu, I think you have interesting things to say	0
but it's not a personal thing,	0
I'm just trying to make this channel a bit more tight as far as security etc.	0
operators should never make decisions based on personal interest	0
we are representatives of the channel, not ourselves personally	0
you are already taking your role very seriously, mister dict... president	0
I've done this before	0
yeah dude this is just some irc hobby thing	0
Thanks for your input	0
is that sarcasm?	0
That's exactly why you shouldn't be op, loudercake, you don't see it as a serious thing	0
because its NOT	0
Okay	0
it is not that serious, this is not a country... but is not like this is nothing either! just a place to have conversations 	0
test bots	0
yeah i know	0
and have fun	0
Well, if you don't want me to be op, I can demote myself	0
yes having fun	0
im going to start a automatic chess playing on #chess	0
i wasnt going to take fun from people	0
handyc do what you want	0
autonomous chess playing!	0
think of it this way, in order for us to continue to have fun, in case some bad actors do show up, someone like handyc can shut them up, and he is serious about that kidna stuff	0
Yes, that's it exactly, orangeFlu 	0
orangeFlu: I fixed my bot, it is being tested on #chess right now	0
I'm not trying to give anyone a hard time	0
nice!	0
I've just seen a lot of projects like this fail before	0
because they have no structure	0
and I am involved in a lot of big projects that do have structure	0
i see	0
This is a small server now, all servers start small	0
but it could be something much larger	0
this is not the next libera	0
larger it could be	0
nor i think it is meant to be libera	0
if it gets larger quickly and we don't have the proper structures in place, it will all fall apart	0
it wont	0
It doesn't matter if it's meant to grow to the size of a giant network or not, the point is that without structure, any project falls apart	0
you know what would be funny	0
but like I said, if you don't want me to be op, I will demote myself, again	0
this feels like a sermon now	0
You can take it as that	0
orangeflu thats handyc	0
I have a lot of strong opinions about these things	0
we create some sort of game that we can code bots to play, and then compete who creates the best ones!	0
loudercake: what? i knoe	0
I don't like to waste my time on doomed projects, my time is limited	0
orangeflu: i meant thats how he is like	0
it's fine, i like it	0
and its not bad	0
listen the old guy	0
every project needs that kind of guy	0
do not get offended please	0
wait why did you jouin here	0
oh he just quit	0
LampGenie?	0
who is lampgenie	0
that's your game bot right?	0
yeah its a new bot	0
you're talking to the bot?	0
it is akinator, for those who know	0
i like akinator	0
i always wanted to make a thing which can listen to all radio waves, and then on the internet you could select any frequency, choose a demodulation technique (AM, FM, USB, LSB, etc) and people can listen to it whatever it is	0
software defined radio	0
yes	0
yeah that's cool	0
im not a radio guy	0
I have seen some projects like that	0
you want to listen to The Buzzer? go ahead	0
mattf: me neither, just know some stuff	0
There are some repeaters online that work that way for shortwave	0

I just use whatever is available	0
orangeflu no what?	0
orangeFlu: vorbeste cu Profilq, e si el vorbitor de romana	0
nano is nice because it's simple and you can usually count on it being available	0
I did a pretty large project over the last 4 years using almost nothing but nano	0
@en ma duc la culcare, pa pa pa	0
I teach my students to use nano	0
I go to bed, Pa Pa Pa  	0
congratualtions learning /me loudercake 	0
handyc: so is vi	0
vi / vim is difficult for beginners to learn, too esoteric	0
gasconheart: ok, paa, noapte buna	0
I teach computer classes to MA students in the humanities	0
they do not know how to do anything	0
I start them on nano	0
then they can use anything they like if they get good enough	0
it's the internet explorer of editors	0
you use it at first to get set up	0
I'm not sure what that means	0
and then install something else	0
orangeflu its just a text editor dude	0
these are just jokes, i don't wanna partake in any text editor wars	0
cool mattf, it looks good!	0
ha, okay	0
I don't really get involved in flame wars either	0
you might be interested in this: i did a small program in lisp that takes a series of constraints and writes code that fulfills those constraints	0
I really do use nano a lot, though	0
Most of my serious programming is not even done at the computer	0
I have most of my good ideas sitting in my back garden	0
say you tell him '((2 3 5), (9 8 17), (1 -1 0)), it will give you back (defun (_1 _2) (+ _1 _2))	0
get it?	0
that's cool, orangeFlu, I have only dabbled in lisp a little but I like the idea of it	0
you describe it the I/O of a program	0
it writes you the code in lisp	0
oh I see	0
have you ever done Haskell?	0
yes	0
i honestly loved it	0
I have been interested in getting into functional programming for several years now but haven't had the time to devote to it	0
but i havent written anything in over a year	0
it's really really cool	0
yeah, I definitely see how it can be very poweful	0
powerful	0
I think functional languages are the future	0
hmm	0
but mostly I use Python right now for everything	0
i will sit here not talking until a ducks pops up	0
most modern languages today have some form of functional ideas into them	0
I think the ducks tend to pop up more when no one is talking	0
like LINQ in C#	0
python has them too	0
yeah, you can do lambda functions in Python	0
every major language has them	0
even C++	0
i think the future is something probably closer to functional, but still, purely functional.. idk man	0
i like the idea that a language has functional and oop 	0
like most do	0
yeah, the real world still depends on time	0
yes, functional languages are much slower	0
cant deny that	0
they may be right for some stuff	0
but in embedded	0
well I think it's difficult to have a pure math function and do a real world process like printing to a printer	0
they wont take off	0
handyc: thats the thing, you cant, thats why monads exist	0
but I don't really know how those things work, I have not done enough with it	0
you need side effects	0
there is a saying, nobody really understands monads	0
I see, so that's what a monad does, I have heard the term	0
ha ha	0
it's a strange term, because I encountered it from Leibniz	0
I guess they must have borrowed it from him	0
yeah, it's a way to achieve side effects in a purely functional languages, where functions by definition dont have side effects	0
it gets more interesting actually	0
I think these purely functional languages will really take off when we have serious quantum computers in the mainstream market	0
all of haskell is just a way to interpret some mathematical concepts. any object or idea in haskell has its math counterpart	0
also things like using bacteria for computing	0
monads included	0
are you familiar with group theory?	0
not really	0
I do not have a very solid understanding of mathematics	0
like what is a group, a ring, a composition rule	0
you do them in 12th grade	0
no, I don't know those things	0
at least here	0
well I took Calc I and II but I have forgotten many things	0
I was in 12th grade in 1997	0
i dont know what calc 1 and 2 means	0
it's not like that here	0
anyway, it is kind of simple in a way	0
I think I could probably understand it if I opened a book on it	0
to get any kind of algebraic structure, you need a set of things, and a composition rule	0
I will read about group theory now and see	0
I also took some linear algebra, statistics, advanced logic	0
say the set of all natural numbers and addition	0
I was in a BS program for CS a long time ago but I didn't complete the degree	0
I have a PhD in Religious Studies, most of my work is on Buddhist monastic law	0
i know, we talked about this	0
listen	0
the set of all natural numbers and addition is an algebraic structure	0
what kind exactly	0
right, okay	0
monoid	0
there is a hierarchy of these kinds of structures	0
okay	0
each one has more features than the next	0
ring	0
and to classify them, you have to ascertain things like: is the composition rule associative, commutative, does it have a neutral element?	0
okay	0
yes, that makes sense to me	0
for addition, the answers are yes, yes and yes (0 is neutral, because any number + 0 is still that number)	0
good	0
and you can build stuff akin to these structures in haskell	0
you can draw parallels between them	0
right, that sounds extremely powerful	0
once you get to monad, you get side effects	0
that is just the kind of thing I have been looking for	0
i don't know the EXACT reasons for why this happens or how it works	0
but it is all based on group theory	0
well, I will have to read up on it,	0
which is easier to understand than what people make of it	0
I opened the Wiki article on Group Theory just now	0
some of what you are saying makes sense, but I need to refresh myself on the terminology	0
I took a Discrete Math course for CS way back when and we dabbled with these things a little	0
i think what i told you is right, but i'm not 100% sure, i may have made a mistake here or there, but all in all, the concepts are right	0
it seems so weird to me that i don't know what you are talking about, calc 1, calc 2, discrete math? for me, discrete math meant something totally different in college	0
doesnt seem to be connected	0
what is calc 1 and 2?	0
Discrete Math in my CS course in university was for dealing with finite concepts	0
truth tables and stuff	0
Calc I and II is for continuous functions	0
learning to take a derivative and integral	0
in Discrete Math I remember we had to make up our own operators and things and write out truth tables for them	0
for me it was the mathematics concerning discrete signals, like those used in computers	0
no this was like finite logic	0
binary logic	0
no, that was called combinatorial math	0
weird	0
why are things named differently here	0
for example, learning how to convert a statement like "when A, B" to use only NAND statements	0
no idea, I didn't name the course	0
but it dealt with discrete things, so it's discrete math	0
this was in the USA	0
I'm from the US originally	0
digital integrated circuits	0
calculus i did in 11th grade, in highschool	0
and a bit in 12th, when we got to integrals	0
Well, like I said, I graduated high school in 1997,	0
there were not as many options for computer things back then	0
yes, i see	0
I took all the math classes available to me in high school,	0
i think here there were none	0
but it was really just a taste	0
I took Calc I in high school and bombed it	0
bombed it?	0
then I took it again in university and did okay	0
oh, got you	0
basically I failed the class the first time, it was too much for me	0
but then it made sense the second time arounf	0
around	0
Calc II was a bit much for me	0
but this was 20 years ago	0
probably now I could handle it better	0
calc 2 was integrals?	0
yeah	0
its weird because we do those in highschool, in college we start with double and triple integrals over geometric structures, that i couldnt really understand	0
nor did i need it	0
well, I wish those things had been available to me earlier	0
Americans do not usually get a very good background in math	0
i heard that	0
I even took those courses that I did take by choice,	0
most people are not required to have anything beyond algebra	0
Even my parents thought it was stupid of me to take so much math	0
its fascinating to me that you can choose what to learn, i wish i could've chosen some more interesting stuff and leave the boring stuff aside	0
The US public education system has been collapsing for years	0
Well, I think it's good to be well rounded, but this is a very American idea	0
I think it did make me a better person having some choices and being forced to do other things	0
i would have taken more physics and math and cs stuff in highschool, less french and romanian literary studies which i couldnt care less for	0
Initially I was only interested in computer stuff,	0
it was only after I had to take history classes, which I did find boring at first, that I realized I didn't know anything about history,	0
oh yeah, and geography	0
and I ended up getting a BA in History to undo my ignorance	0
and then I got into Classics, which is basically Latin and Greek	0
americans never know anything about geography and hsitory outside their own, is a famous joke here	0
got a BA in that	0
and that's how I got into ancient religions	0
Yeah, it's really sad how little Americans know	0
interesting	0
i love those videos with "point on the map the location of US" or "name 3 continents"	0
the first continent is always "us of a"	0
https://github.com/Flu/program-synth	0
Title: GitHub - Flu/program-synth: A program that synthesizes programs based on constraints	0
mattf: for you	0
don't know if you can run it, you need some stuff for it to work	0
a few packages from qlisp IIRC	0
Profilq: esti aici?	0
that's your github?	0
that one, a few lines up	0
nothing interesting there, apart from maybe this program	0
cool, I followed you	0
thanks	0
i wish i put things on it more often	0
but i have so many things i want to do	0
i feel overwhelmed	0
and end up not doing anything	0
I know how it is	0
I am embarrassed by my GitHub repos	0
I have to clean up so much shit there	0
for example, i stopped that game in rust you see there because i got tangled in quaternions and felt very stupid and havent touched it since	0
i am embarassed as well	0
believe me	0
ha ha	0
yeah, such is life	0
i'm going for a smoke, brb in about 10 minutes	0
I have a bunch of repos that are just a title	0
okay, I'll still be here	0

it would be duck fraus	0
well, it's allowed in the rules	0
duck fraud is a serious issue handyc	0
this might be a different version of gonzo, though	0
these ducks are my friends, so why can't I send them to anyone I like	0
the ducks work for me	0
because they are YOUR friends	0
yeah good point	0
friends arent workers mr capitalist	0
I was thinking less as workers,	0
more like diplomats	0
thats somehow worse	0
I don't think I'm a particularly good capitalist	0
i want a cat	0

cats are awesome	0
i have one	0
whats their name	0
Luna	0
it means "the moon" in romanian	0

so you know, not pure breed or anything	0
where were you from again?	0

I was just in the shower for a minute	0
Title: Wide-band WebSDR in Enschede, the Netherlands	0
look what i found	0
nice!	0
in the netherlands even	0
i want something exactly like this, but with maybe a nicer interface and more features	0
yeah, well you can get kits	0
for the hardware	0
once i get a raspberry pi with an antenna and learn how to process the signal, the rest is not that hard for me	0
no kits	0
that is boring	0
ha, okay	0
I have a Pi 4	0
there's a cape you can get for it	0
plus, here, in romania, you can hear the buzzer much more clearly	0
i wished i had a pi	0
i have 3 rpi 4	0
so i could have a pihole	0
Pi Zero W 2 just came out the other day	0
i heard, it looks awesome	0
again, so many ideas..	0
yeah, I will probably get one,	0
I have the Zero, the 2B and the 4	0
i should just buy a fucking antenna and start the project already	0
i only have 3 rpi 4, and one rpi 3	0
sure, no time like the present	0
they are great, I make little custom Internet radio devices with them	0
also, you can hear the buzzer now if you never heard it before	0
I bought a small screen from Waveshare	0
it's night in NE	0
so no interference	0
I find old computer speakers in the garbage and gut them,	0
and then attach them to the Pi	0
tune in to 4625 kHz and set the mode to USB	0
loudercake: try it	0
handyc: interesting	0
and you made a radio with that?	0
not a "radio" but an Internet streaming device	0
not using radio waves	0
try what orangeflu	0
but a box the shape of a radio,	0
like a bedroom alarm clock radio	0
I made a simple screen display program with tkinter	0
so it displays the time and date and what you are streaming	0
loudercake: hear the buzzer, it's an old military station from russia which sounds kind of eerie 	0
hang on, I will show you a picture of one of my prototypes	0
broadcasts 24/7	0
it is believed it is for people to keep off the frequency, as it is reserved	0
so it broadcasts a buzzing sound	0
sends chills down my spine	0
https://imgur.com/a/Y2LSeRF	0
Title: handyc radio - Album on Imgur	0
enter the site i gave a few minutes ago	0
enter the frequency 6425	0
and select USB	0
6425	0
sorry, back	0
it is not a numbers station, no	0
it sometimes does broadcast codes	0
but they are not regular transmissions	0
by any means	0
and rare	0
so it doesn't fit the numbers station criteria	0
I can't hear it clearly enough to pick out anything	0
hhmm, yeah, i don't hear it either	0
it should be an intermitten buzz, 1 second of pause and another buzz and so on	0
i listened to it like yesterday on a similar site	0
yeah, but I seem to be hearing human voices in the background	0
or maybe I am just imagining the voices	0
really?	0
wooow	0
sometimes pink noise sounds like voices to me	0
this is super rare	0
but this sounds like real voices	0
sometimes the machine breaks and you can hear voices in the background	0
yeah, very faint	0
the buzzing is generated mechanically	0
the voices could be leaking from some other frequency	0
they sound distorted	0
i have never heard voices from other frequencies, as you can see, any used frequency nearby is far away	0
and USB doesn't use much bandwidth anyway	0
if that were true, and you move the wellow thingy, does it get clearer?	0
i think i can hear some voices too	0
maybe	0
THE BUZZER IS DOWN	0
i dont know why i am so excited about this	0
back	0
computer crashed again	0
it crashes whenever i use youtube or anything that streams audio/video 	0
oh, that sucks	0
so if you said anything since my last message, i didnt see it	0
i cant fix it	0
no matter what i do	0
https://imgur.com/a/Y2LSeRF	0
Title: handyc radio - Album on Imgur	0
and again	0
...	0
and i only opened imgur	0
wtf	0
anyway, i could take a good look though	0
what's with all the knobs?	0
those go to a Teensy 2	0
they are analog pots	0
10K pots	0
that way I can feed analog stuff into the Pi	0
the Teensy 2 is masquerading as a 9600 bps modem device and sending to the Pi through USB	0
I can program those knobs to do anything	0
so for example, say I have a list of internet radio streams,	0
I could have 100 different streams, for example, in a text file,	0
and I can make one of the knobs flip through those streams,	0
just like tuning a real radio	0
interesting	0
really really cool	0
thanks	0
whats a teensy 2?	0
It's a microcontroller	0
like an arduino but more powerful	0
i know what that is :)	0

now i didnt even open a browser	0
how do you even do your job as a programmer with a computer like that	0
i don't, it only started doing this since like half an hour ago	0
oh shit	0
idk what is happening	0
is it a desktop or notebook?	0
it used to do it only when watching netflix	0
but now...?	0
do you think it's overheating?	0
it is not	0
notebook	0
the kernel has some errors	0
battery is charged?	0
but cant find anythign about them	0
let me take a look before it does it again	0
battery is fine	0
you might want to shut it off and check it out thoroughly	0
otherwise you could be doing permanent damage	0
if it's hardware	0
do you have a program that tells you the internal temperatures of the components?	0
50 degrees all around the cores	0

could you please past me the error?	0

yes, the one with the flush	0
copy and paste it so i can see it again	0

me neither	0
until i did it	0
its very therapeutic	0
Almost ever smoker I've ever met is trying to quit	0
feel much better	0
*every	0
Yeah, that makes sense	0
I tried it a few times, felt like licking a toilet	0
they are not trying to quit because it doesnt make them feel good	0
but because they know what might come	0
which is reasonable	0
yeah, it seems like a small reward given the high risks involved	0
i personally got smoking because an ex of mine was a smoker and i wanted to impress	0
i know, i know, bad idea	0
oh really?	0
i was dumb	0
I have been married about 12 years, I no longer try to impress 	0
me neither right now, it seems there are no upsides, i am just being me, trying to make her feel comfortable and thats it	0

unbelievably, the default shell is /bin/sh	0

awesome, thanks	0
I am pretty content with NetBSD for 32-bit so far	0
orangeFlu: look at the shortcuts part and the "dmenu = ..." part. it uses dmenu to make things interactive.	0
 	0
the support for the Spanish keyboard is good, it displays Spanish, Gascon and Romanian characters, it uses the latest version of openssh, desupporting 32-bit is one of the priorities of the developers, and they don't plan on desupporting it in the foreseeable future	0
NetBSD provides the piece of mind Debian Linux does not to a 32-bit user like me	0
there is only a problem with your reasoning gasconheart	0
i already have dmenu	0
which is good	0
what is the problem, mattf 	0
but say i get an sms and the notification comes through, can i answer it?	0
kdeconnect supports that	0
developers in general already abandoned 32 bits. like you had that ssh problem, you will soon run into another problems because the software there will be too old. Can take just a little bit longer to happen... anyway	0
as long as you can ssh to a 4 bits newer machine 	0
it works	0
orangeFlu: i think so but i never tried this with the dmenu thing	0
i dont receive sms's :P	0
mattf: also just noticed everything is hardcoded for your machine :(	0
that sucks	0
i think on kde like even for apps like telegram i could reply but now i use telegram in emacs	0
orangeFlu: what do you mean by "everything is hardcoded for my machine" ?	0
oh you mean the script paths?	0
with my name on it	0
username	0
hahaha yeah you cant just straight copy my dotfiles	0
and you probably wouldn't want it anyway	0
you can run a sed replace or if you use vim...	0
the script paths, the icons	0
i already replaced them with my own, thanks	0
there werent that many	0
yeah but i have some scripts there, like you dont even that mailspring thing at all	0
it's much easier to write $HOME or ~ than /home/mattf i think :))	0
(but it is cool you can call your own scripts when there is a notification)	0
yeah but that doesn't always work	0
i will do a quick reboot to see how everything is working	0
with a little luck, it will go beautifully	0
brb	0
mattf: sure some component will become outdated at some point, most likely soon, probably openssh itself... but for the next 3 years at least I'm confident I'll be well supplied	0
i think it works in dunst but i got used on not using it	0
good luck	0
weirdly enough, it works fine	0
hah cool	0
buut the notifications from whatsapp are just too big	0
i need to tweak the config a little	0
anyway, thanks	0
it helped a lot	0
well yeah, dunst is quite customizable	0
gasconheart is really right about switching to bsd! we are 5 linux users here and 3 use arch! it has become a normie thing!	0

emacs was for other stuff, but i havent used it in quite some time	0
it is good though	0
i kinda miss it sometime	0
the possibilities	0
i went as far as configuring vscode to be full keyboard driven and use my neovim config	0
then i figured out i could do the same on emacs and it would be better	0
i had a welcome screen with the weather and news and i controlled my spotify through it...	0

im using emacs right now on this chat	0
i did the same with vscode but with emacs bindigns	0
i am a vi guy... thus evil mode	0

mattf: I can call the lieutenant, I can email him	0
organFly: I completely understand not want the emacs setup trouble again... 	0
so catgirl is an irc client hah?	0
by the way, in case there is ever a need, here is my email adrian.fluturel@protonmail.com	0
i like the emacs client by the way, its pretty nice	0

orangeFlu is from IRSSI, organFly is from emacs 	0

is he the lieutenant, gasconheart ?	0

wow elp!	0
that was fast!!!!!!	0
welcome, lieutenent	0
we have 3 arch users and 3 emacs users	0
!!!	0
you've been summoned indeed, hahahaah	0
arch! some masochistic people around I see	0
elp: welcome to our new server !	0
thanks for coming, elp 	0
again, i havent used emacs in quite some time, but before, in the good good times, i loved it	0
elp: everything is new around here	0
arch is still very close to my heart though	0
you might not realize but this is an irc server set up by me now! the bots are faster, the server is faster, and it has, what does it have?	0
i dont think i will ever trade it for anything else	0
oh tls!	0
elp: I am transitioning to Arch Linux and to NetBSD now; I had been a Linux Debian user for years	0
thats right you can use port 6697 ! 	0
without sasl which is nice	0
ah come oooon	0
i said its nice	0
you still said it	0
i can setup sasl eventually	0
I tried to install it ONCE. And I gave up. Not because of knowledge but because I'm lazy. Arch is like 1998 never ended.	0
dont	0
mattf is a great guy and a great admin	0
I was surprised I wasn't asked for a floppy	0
elp: I "cheated", I am using Manjaro, which is Arch with an installer for dummies	0
did you count me in as an arch user as well?	0
orangeFlu: what's up, baby?	0
you and organFlute are the same	0
organFly: hello, beautiful	0
organFlute?	0
the latest version of NetBSD, 9.2 released in May 2021, still supports installation from floppy disks for 32-bit machines	0
i gotta make a new one	0
netbsd is fine, they are changing the default font after like 50 years, and updated the base desktop	0
elp: arch is just pain to get installed.... after that it will just break things randomly after each update	0
:P	0
mattf: not true	0
i know	0
oh mattf 	0
you "sold" me Arch..... don't scare me away now......	0
i only had a real problem like that once... well maybe 3 times	0
organFlute: have you read the interview with elp in my blog?	0
it never broke for me, things were never more broken than they were in ubuntu for me, it was pretty smooth sailing aside from the wifi chip driver shit	0
gasconheart: no, only the matt one	0

romania	0
i'm popularising arch in romania	0
gasconheart's recruiting is working	0
i'm trying to get all my friends to switch to linux	0

orangeFlu: I have just converted Profilq to Linux!!	0
what, really?	0
what linux?	0
I sent him some CDs like 10 days ago	0
well	0
Mint for his 64-bit computer	0
orangeFlu: thats a good goal, however you should encourage them to switch to free software instead of just "linux" otherwise it would be a convenience change and not an ethical change.	0
and I forgot what exactly for his 32-bit machine	0
my 2 cents 	0
orangeFlu: maybe you can help *me* assist *him* to install Linux when the time comes :)	0

good evening, handyc!	0
how's it going, gasconheart?	0
hi, handyc 	0
going well, thanks, handyc 	0
i am his twin evil brother	0
trying to get used to NetBSD	0
Are both twins evil or just the one?	0
gasconheart do you have MA access on SDF?	0
just one, but you wont know which until its too late	0
handyc: I don't think so	0
I would think you would be used to BSD from SDF	0
I'm just a regular user	0
well the main cluster is also BSD	0
handyc: that's right, but there I have just a user space; here I own the whole thing, I have root privileges and such	0
SDF is the largest free NetBSD service in the world	0
I know	0
yeah, makes sense	0
that's right, it's different when you have access to logs and things	0
yep	0
One of my students tried to DDOS my course server last week	0
I am so proud of him	0
hey by the way	0
hahahaha	0
I told my students to hack me if they can	0
a DDoS is not really "hacking", but annoying	0
I need to review the logs and see what he tried to do, I think it was a pretty weak attack	0
he said it didn't seem to be effective at all	0
but I am so proud of him for doing it and then telling me	0
by the way, how can I check the date I opened my account at SDF, handyc ? thanks	0

handyc: give me the ip maybe?	0

hahahaha	0
meaning i cant hack you?	0
I am just kidding, please do try	0
Our server is more resilient to ddos now	0
 	0
but if you find a hole may I request that you tell me	0
so that I can fix it	0
unrealircd come with many dos protections by default	0

please try to hack us	0
because this is running the whole course, if you bring the server down then people will have trouble finishing the course	0
January 2015; so I've been using NetBSD (somehow) for 6 years	0
i will try not to bring it down	0
thanks man	0
logging in a shell with everything you will need already installed  == using?	0
but i will do some enumeration on it, see whats what	0
yeah, I'd like to see what you come up with	0
yes, mattf 	0
ok then	0
there are surely security issues on that server	0
some people want a system that just works, not every one of us is a masochist trying arch or gentoo	0
handyc: sure, i will give it a look, probably in the weekend	0

mattf you befriended a duck in 6.240 seconds! You have made friends with 236 ducks in #romanian.	0
I want a system that just works, but I also want to know everything about every system for my own edification	0
So I try to make sensible choices based around what is popular and stable,	0
most of my servers run Ubuntu because that is what our university will give you if you ask for a Linux account,	0
so I make a system that is as close as possible to what the students will get elsewhere at the university,	0
that way they can move their projects around easily	0
but I also want to be familiar with these things like Arch,	0
so that if someone asks me in a job interview if I have experience with Arch, I can say that I do	0
My basic philosophy around software development is that code should be portable, readable and maintainable above other things,	0
optimization can come later	0
there back again	0

I'm glad that your daughter has a composition of animals, you have remembered by this of my experience of my lived when we were in the fifth grade, the theme being "the forest." I had a lot of soul in altogus, involving me by content as such, and an inspiration above the perceptual level of a child of my age, given that M always attracted nature.  	0

no but how do I tell textual to use SASL	0
i just sent a link	0

I think the instructions are missing something	0
there is also a clickbox that says something about secure connections,	0
I think I have to enable that also	0

which was a witch	0
I don't know, mattf, British people are weird	0
harry potter is from england	0
yeah and he's weird	0
yeah	0
mattf, was it difficult to set up SASL?	0
I would like to copy all of your good ideas if at some point I start my own small server	0
the bad ideas I will not copy	0
nah not really hard	0
im using lets encrypt for the ssl	0
oh okay	0
I also use that for all my websites	0
everybody uses letsencrypt	0
i created a block with the ip of my vps allowing it to send a message each 10 ms without throtling	0
afaik the only free option	0
I never figured out how to properly use it to cover the entire domain name	0
since me and loudercake use the znc from there and all bots	0
that is why the bots are faster	0
I have a bunch of them for different subdomains	0
handyc: its complicated	0
oh really?	0
orangeFlu: we have sasl now	0
i can tell you	0
are you happy	0
yes, please do	0
FluteOrgan are you happy?	0
i hopy you are	0
because I have about 100 student users on my dhlinguistics server now from 4 years of teaching this class	0
basically for individual url you use http validation to prove the site is yours	0
correct?	0
it's a huge pain in the ass to validate each on individually	0
but	0
yeah I guess so	0
I use cerbot	0
certbot	0
for domains, say "*.domain.com" you cant use that	0
right	0
becuase there isnt a single site	0
wildcard domains	0
so no http	0
they support that too	0
you need dns validation	0
I have each student on my server set up as user.dhlinguistics.com	0
which basically means you need to make a DNS record	0
okay	0
of type TXT	0
okay	0
idk where you manage your domains	0
I user Gandi	0
but they can let you do that	0
I know how to edit DNS	0
for sure	0
*use	0
ipv4 record	0
okay, thanks	0
ipv6 record	0
yeah, I use ipv4 right now	0
so a TXT record is only a domain that when you access returns a string	0
I can't remember if I set up ipv6 on that one	0
I see	0
not an ip	0
but does that slow down the site?	0
usually the program you use for validation will tell you	0
or does it only access that TXT entry once when it makes the cert?	0
take this string here and make a txt record with it	0
then it will access the url	0
and if it returns the string it gave you	0
which is a big key	0
it will know you control the whole domain	0
okay, makes sense, I will check the certbot manual and see	0
depending on who you get your domains from, they may be able to renew the certificates automatically when it expires	0
if not, you have to do it manually every 90 days	0
which sucks, but better than doing it individually for every domain	0
subdomain*	0
if that doesnt work, i've found Certify The Web to be very good	0
just look for dns validation	0
orangeFlu: we have sasl btw	0
https://docs.certifytheweb.com/docs/dns/validation/	0
Title: DNS Validation (dns-01) | Certify The Web Docs	0
mattf: ok	0
thanks orangeFlu, I will try this soon	0
i didnt want it though :)	0
but some people may want it	0
it's been a good experience running this small site for a class	0
it is nice to have	0
at first I was very sloppy and did everything by hand	0
but after I hit a certain point, it became overwhelming	0
now I have a lot of custom scripts to automate things	0
i see	0
I have about 20 students per year	0
and this is the 4th year of the class	0
so now there are somewhere between 80 and 100 users	0
I'm thinking of open sourcing this whole class	0
and putting all the homework and everything on GitHub	0
sure, why not	0
My wife thinks I should try to sell the course on Udacity or something	0
whats the downside?	0
but I think open source is better	0
i dont agree with that	0
well, she thinks I should try to milk it for as much money as I can get	0
with your wife, i mean	0
but I think if I open source it, more people will see it	0
i do believe in the freedom of information	0
i understand your wife but you should do both	0
Yeah, I think it's possible to do both	0
if you want to create udemy course	0
if you dont want to then just open source all	0
its just like rhel vs centos	0
Yeah, Udemy  is what I meant	0
in udemy, you could personally help who buys the course	0
right, so I could do both	0
but it should be the same imformation on both	0
and people who don't want to pay can just look at the homework	0
yes	0
and people who do want to pay can get an account on my server	0
like this flutter course i did, all apps are in github free for everyone to see	0
now t he explanation and the real educative content is on udemy	0
Yeah, that's more in the spirit of DH anyway	0
yeah you can do that too	0
ken: do you want to cash in on this too?	0
orangeFlu: Yes I would love to 	0
who joins our course gets that server access thing and whatever else	0
It's difficult convincing my wife that anything I do with my software is "real"	0
I told her I was going to start making mobile phone apps and try to make some money	0
in what way, real?	0
I think she is finally starting to take it seriously	0
real = you get money out of it?	0
I don't think she believed my skills were good enough to make a piece of software that people would actually pay money for	0
and maybe at one time that was true	0
but I have been thinking about this for several years now	0
and getting better as I develop my project for my job	0
All the EU funded projects are supposed to be open access for everything	0
so our software is also all open source	0
so even after the project ends, the software is mine to do with as I please	0
really?	0
I made my own custom toolkit for developing Django apps automatically	0
it's not very complicated but it saves me a lot of time	0
if you package it right, it might get pretty popular	0
Yeah, that's what I'm working on now	0
this company is interviewing me next week and they want to see some sample code	0
so I am trying to tighten everything up this week to show them	0
and get all the documentation and everything pretty	0
They interviewed me once already	0
so if I do well next week, they will hire me	0
but even if they don't, I think someone will hire me if I get this all packaged up nicely	0
and even if that doesn't happen, I will just use it myself	0
I always try to have multiple contingency plans	0

for me it looks like handyc wrote first	0
weird	0
SUCK gasconheart 	0
.ducks orangeFlu 	0
orangeFlu has killed 1 duck and befriended 9 ducks in #romanian.	0
they're gone	0
the ducks?	0
no, they are my friends	0
didnt left my rooma	0
let me try this catgirl irc client	0
hahaha	0
seems quite minimalistic	0
I like minimalistic things	0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSY7ecKyfuU	0
russian hardbass	0
kinda	0
not really	0
is that what the kids listen to dtoday?	0
it is what i listen to	0
these guys make rally good music	0
s/rally/really	0
these guys make really good music	0
i can't get into this trap thing	0
its not trap though	0
by a long shot	0
well let me explain better	0
its actually good music, sometimes hard bass-y, sometimes more like rap, sometimes edm	0
i can't get into music where there is no melody	0
what do you mean by melody?	0
that includes, trap, rap, brazillian funk, 	0
songs where people are just talking over a beat	0
or that the melody is only 2 or 3 notes	0
i have the stuff for you then	0
ever heard of apashe?	0
he combines classical music with electronic?	0
it sounds godlike	0
he has a really broad style	0
poor cat	0
sounds better	0
its a very good kitty	0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xnYfN-K-hk	0
what happened with the bot that used to spell out titles?	0
I like old music usually	0
what happened with youtube	0
even the title tag is generated by js now?	0
that sucks	0
idk, i am just supposing	0
anyway, listen to the last one i gave you	0
loudercake: what color	0
i mean, at work, the titles do come from the backend into javascript which it then sets, so very possible	0
white with a bit of grey	0
orangeFlu: im listening	0
gonzobot's link preview thing wont render js	0
I'm not on X11 right now	0
what are you a bot?	0
haha the funny line	0
gasconheart: wayland?	0
i dont like those memes but	0
no...	0
TTY!	0
Absolutely no one:	0
you madman	0
gasconheart: I am not on x11 right now	0
gasconheart i got a cat	0
orangeFlu: Oh you missed the gasconheart bot i made	0
oh! congratulations, loudercake!	0
gasconheart basically says 3 things	0
yes	0
tho its hiding scared under my bed now	0
mail that to me son, i am not on x11 right now	0
I have 3 or 4 catch phrases, and that's all my conversation	0
I drinking brandy	0
and	0
Haaaaaa	0
correct, mattf 	0
orangeFlu: if you want to email me things, you can use the command ,email	0
don't abuse it	0
you shouldn't have revealed the secret 	0
gasconheart: do you know how to use catgirl	0
the command ,email sends the current line of chat to my email, it is hard coded to send email to my address	0
it wants a config file for each host	0
why don't you make like a bot that just combines all the bots you currently have. You can make it really modular, so it takes a message, runs a regex and decides to what "sub-bot" it should forward the command to	0
naaah	0
i think it would be pretty sick	0
this is what cloudbot is	0
and limnoria	0
limnoria is on #bots	0
orangeFlu: mattf coded THAT, in BASH	0
it even has DOS text based games	0
i already have in my head how i would do this in .net	0
there is also suppybot 	0
gasconheart: coded what in bash exactly?	0
mattf: I only used catgirl once, at ffuentes' OpenBSD server	0
:gh bash irc	0
:gh irc_bash	0
https://github.com/matheusfillipe/irc_bash_bot 	0
Title: GitHub - matheusfillipe/irc_bash_bot: Proof of concept irc bot starting point	0
there are multiple discussions going on and i feel lost	0
oh, that one	0
you can trun shell scripts into bots	0
 	0
orangeFlu: this ChannelBot here is a BASH bot, actually an umbrella under which I can add as many bots as I want	0
so basically what i said?	0
well but it is a hack	0
basically that, orangeFlu 	0
but gasconheart likes bash	0
i made it just for papa	0
my new friends hate me for being a BASH user :)	0
i think the advantage with what i said is that you have one bot that reads the input and activates only the bot/bots with whom it matches, instead of tens of bots checking the same input at every message	0
my new friends = the NetBSD users	0
better on the server	0
when multiple people speak	0
orangeFlu: you are describing limnoria 	0
like many more	0
it even has a package manager	0
I don't "like" BASH, it is only that I am very used to it.............	0
it has uno	0
who wants to play uno	0
idk what limnoria is, i just had an idea and described it :))	0
I don't like Uno......	0
i play uno	0
quick game	0
"uno" is a variant of "crazy eights"	0
i dont remember how to use this bot though	0
every time i have to relearn it	0
awesome	0
brb	0
come to #bots	0
whoever wants to play uno	0
come loudercake 	0
i would use a mediator pattern for the dispatch between the front-end (regex matching engine) and the bots themselves, to separate them cleanly	0
we can play uno and chess at the same time	0
Hello everyone! 	0
I like your Russian hardbass song, orangeFlu 	0
ken, did you eat your face	0
handyc: Why, of course you may 	0
ken please fold yourself in half twenty times	0

Hello everyone! 	0

ken what do you think about mattf's duck collection	0
handyc: I like you very much ;) 	0
ken I'm talking about ducks	0
handyc: What do you want to know about me 	0
ken have you ever tried Peking Duck?	0
mattf have you ever eaten a duck tongue?	0
handyc: Ohh so many times 	0
the other day my wife served me a bowl of duck tongues for dinner	0
like 15 of them	0
they have a little bone in them	0
I don't think I had eaten a duck tongue before that	0
no i never eat those weird things you talk about sometimes	0
It's probably not something I would get a craving for	0
but actually I enjoy eating duck necks very much	0
Yeah, Chinese people eat some crazy stuff	0
i ever ate a duck	0
You never ate duck?	0
Oh, it's great	0
Very fatty and oily	0
Do you eat rabbit?	0
no no	0
It's kind of like rabbit meat	0
i ate javalis	0
I forgot what that is	0
You must eat a lot of beef	0
I think Brazil produces more beef than anybody else	0
yeah sometimes	0
if you mean cow	0
oh, Brazil is second	0
US is number one for beef	0
Yeah beef is cow	0
meat is so expensive here	0
thats why we even hunt	0
oh really	0
what do you hunt?	0
My uncle hunts for deer in the US	0
He makes it into sausage and jerky	0
javalis 	0
oh javalis is the name of an animal	0
we only got 2 but it is a lot	0
I was thinking it was the name of a dish	0
no it is boar	0
idk if that it is the english name	0
oh okay	0
yeah	0
i guess "wild boar" in english	0
wild pig, boar	0
I like that too	0
We got some boar meat in China one time	0
it has a more gamey taste than pig from the supermarket	0
gamey is that wild taste	0
Hello everyone! 	0
Bun venit, ken, în serverul IRC al lui Gasconheart! Fii răbdător, curând o să vină cineva să vorbească cu tine. 	0
hi ken, do you like to eat boar meat	0
our chess game is getting the bots banned	0
unrealircd has all sorts of limits	0
to prevent dos	0
can't you raise the limits?	0
i did but i didn't figure out what all of the limits are yet	0
What will happen if many users come here?	0
thats why we are testing this	0
no the limits are because of the same ip	0
is it because all the bots are on one IP?	0
yeah	0
okay	0
yes	0
can you make some kind of shadow IP	0
i wish there was a thing just to mark "this ip is never spam"	0

sandbox?	0
no they really like the sandbox if it is close	0
my mom doesnt want it on the room	0
because the smell would be bad or something	0
even tho i will have to keep the door open for the lil guy to roam around	0
well this is screwed up, you live in a city	0
dont worry	0
constrain it to your room or something during the night	0
idk	0
yeah thats what i do	0
i close stuff	0
we should get screens when the cat gets too big	0
and starts being able to reach stuff	0
yeah	0
can be very problematic	0
cats can learn not to do stupid things	0
maybe	0
they can	0
im just glad they're fine	0

oh i got the lol hex colors	0

lol	0
its plain text to me	0
horrible	0
hahahah	0
maybe you could pipe all that to something	0
oh god elp try to build catgirl	0
you mean tls.c is missing?	0
I'll try compile again hold on	0
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `libtls.pc'	0
its been added	0
so i don't get it	0
you ran ./configure ?	0
i did exactly that mattf	0
what is it ./configure that complains about libtls missing?	0
elp 	0
maybe reinstall the package	0
on ubuntu there is also gnutll-bin	0
gnutls-bin	0
could also be libressl	0
install all those :P	0
also try apt reinstall	0
If installing libtls manually to /usr/local, for example, make sure /usr/local/lib appears in /etc/ld.so.conf or /etc/ld.so.conf.d/* and be sure to run ldconfig(8) once the library is installed. Set PKG_CONFIG_PATH for ./configure to find it.	0
check if libtls is locatable 	0
already done that... im reading that debian 11 doesn't include libtls	0
i'll find a workaround tomorrow	0
you will have to build it then	0
well well	0
elp btw maybe you know this about erc	0
I cannot send empty lines, it will complain it is empty	0
but if i type something and hit shift return after it	0
 	0
gnutls is not the same	0
it sends the empty damn line	0
yeah but after 2 it halts	0
it happens all the time i paste something	0
wow	0

wanted to kill a line	0
killed the program	0

im gonna get the proper thing	0

much better	0
define-class ? OOP in lisp? this is so weird	0
scheme is nice	0
you can have inline anything	0

guile is good	0
ooooh	0
the book is also good	0
the fsf book on guile	0

guile is also a lisp 	0
?????	0
lisp what	0
dialect	0
guile is the FSF version of Scheme	0
scheme comes from the MIT	0
there was a "thing" trying to move elisp to guile	0
besides the guys behind guix were traitors of stallman	0
lol	0
the lisp world	0
they signed that petition to get him removed	0
my first contact with lisp was on autocad	0
they still use lisp for their scripts	0
then we got a couple nerds and made the Free Software Force, published a manifesto and all	0
lisp was once what python is nowadays	0
it was pretty cool	0
it was	0

the MIT classes are on youtube	0
the scripting frontend for stuff	0
I wont be sectarian and say python is bad. Its ok. I just don't like the semantics of it	0
if it breaks it has backtrace (same as any lisp)	0
so... its ok	0
is like me saying i dont like lisp :P	0
too many parenthesis, idk	0
feels like everything is an endless one liner	0
i just find reading python as some sort of person that has boobs and penis its confusing and controversial	0
YES! <3 one liners	0
python is pseudocode	0
i like one liners too	0

the more features they add to it, the closer it gets to bash	0
Windows has finally entered the 1970s	0
my student is trying to download image scans of old Korean books from a university library site that forces the user to load a special Windows-only image browsing utility in the browser	0
it's very weir,	0
weird,	0
we had to load this special program first and then send special requests to the browser through a custom PowerShell script	0
basically he wants to be able to download an entire book quickly but the proprietary interface only allows him to do it one page at a time and it's very slow	0
so we looked at the URL that was being called for the page images and made a simple 'for' loop that would grab each page one by one	0
it works	0
the solution was very simple, he just didn't think of doing it	0
so I quickly did some Google-fu on how PowerShell works and we got it going in about 20 minutes	0
Oh awesome	0
Those things are really worth to learn	0
yeah	0
that's one thing I really work hard to get my students to understand	0
how to make hacky solutions for weird problems	0
but only a few people really get it	0
this student has a lot of experience with Python but not much experience with operating systems	0
hi mattf how are you	0
so he can make formally correct Python programs but he doesn't know as much about trying these weird solutions	0
unpopular opinion: powershell is in almost every way superior to bash, it does have its shortcomings but you know, overall i like it more	0
Interesting handyc	0
Hi gasconheart	0
And organ flute	0
i would change my name but i have to register again	0
I don't know enough about PowerShell to know how it really compared to bash,	0
but I will say this much,	0
Hahaha	0
Windows sucks ass for unicode	0
Windows sucks ass	0
Any time I am dealing with non roman character sets, Windows is a huge pain in the ass	0
really? i hadnt had any problems	0
How often do you work with non roman character sets?	0
Wsl is cool though	0
windows sucks ass in general, but has redeeming features like powershell and wsl	0
Certainly it's good to know how Windows works, since it's so popular, but I don't think for most of the things I do that it's worth the effort	0
But I am trying to make my GA program work with any system automatically	0
It has been the most difficult part of the project so far	0
mattf: what was the other one, with the Fly at the end?	0
orangeFlu, organFlute and there was a third	0
OrangeFly?	0
OrganFly	0
it cant be organ or orange, think of a different but similar word and i will register that one as well	0
i will go setup sasl	0
will be back	0
SASL biatch	0
by the way, whatever happened with the + in front of my name? the voice	0
there you are, chum	0
an op has to give you voice every time, orangeFlu 	0
really?	0
isnt that like.. shitty?	0
I think so	0
not really	0
the op gives voice to users according to needs; there is no reason for granting that automaticallt, like the @	0
why isnt handyc op anymore?	0
Or whatever he was	0
idk	0
hey, the tail command is different in NetBSD	0
I have to tweak my BASH scripts for them to run on NetBSD	0
I have to "port" my BASH scripts :)	0
Hahaha	0
Have fun gasconheart	0
At least it is bash and not c	0
You laugh but C is pretty portable these days	0
bash is optional, and can't be made the default!	0
I have to type "bash" and fire it up all the time	0
Maybe of you edit /etc/passwd	0
yes	0
And change your shell to bash	0
there is the command chsh for that preciselly	0
Edit it manually	0
you have to provide the full path for BASH or any deprecated shell (!)	0
Add bash to your .profile	0
The full path	0
interesting!	0
wait	0
what should I put in .profile??	0
/bin/bash	0
Don't so this	0
BASH is not allowd to reside in /bin in NetBSD, hahahaha	0
BASH is in  /usr/pkg/bin/bash	0
Whatever the path is but avoid infinite loops	0
ok	0
[ "$SHELL" != "BASH" ] && /bin/bash	0
If the current she'll is not bash run bash	0
Test that gasconheart	0
I mean, figure what SHELL evaluates to in bash and make a check like that	0
ok, but with  /usr/pkg/bin/bash   instead	0
This is bit a very good idea though still	0
Yeah man	0
Of course	0
wait	0
NetBSD uses ash as its /bin/sh. Myriad forks have been produced from the original ash release. These derivatives of ash are installed as the default shell ( /bin/sh ) on FreeBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, MINIX, and in some Linux distributions.	0
Ash!	0
ash? jesus	0
Gasconheart here is how you properly do it	0
cd /usr/pkgsrc/shells/bash    make install clean clean-depends distclean    ln -s /usr/pkg/bin/bash /bin/bash        then edit /etc/usermgmt.conf        group users    base_dir /home    skel_dir /etc/skel    shell /bin/sh    class    homeperm 00    inactive Null (unset)    expire Null (unset)    preserve false        and change /bin/sh to /bin/bash	0
/bin/bash	0
Don't so this	0
ofc not	0
put it in /usr/bin/bash	0
never heard of "ash"	0
that didn't work	0
BASH is not my default	0
it's OK	0
it is a good trade-off	0
I have the latest version of openssh, that was my main goal	0
Gasconheart: /etc/usermgmt.conf	0
bye handyc	0
:(	0
i am done with work	0
let the fun begin	0
/çp	0
what lol	0
you can change the default shell on that file gasconheart 	0
why do the colors on screen look weird?	0
i'm using screen to be able to use irssi on my work computer with ssh	0
and for some reason, the dark variant of ANSI colors dont show up	0
i wonder why	0
orangeFlu: are you sshing from a windows machine?	0
How is this 	0
cant see the s	0
i was sshing from a windows machine	0
now i am not	0
i am on linux	0
irssi through a session of screen	0
without screen, everything is ok	0
with screen, the s disappears	0
and the same happens from linux if you are locally? so this is an issue with screen?	0
maybe use tmux :P	0
well i also had these types of issues with tmux	0
yes, ofc it is with screen if i have it locally	0
i said it is local	0
doesnt happen from windows	0
ah ok	0
i dont really open screen in years, i dont know much about it	0

kde thing	0
the indexer from kde?	0
oh, why?	0
tell gasconheart how to disable it	0
balooctl disable	0
seriosuly, it's that easy	0
why :))	0
balooctl purge	0
it's a good engine	0
better than searching by regex	0
i had it disabled too when i used kde	0
i like regex	0
and ripgrep	0
by default, dolphin uses baloo, but when missing, regex, which is annoying, almost as annoying as the fact that you cant seach by wildcards	0

mattf: yes	0
i guess	0
I started learning rust but stopped	0
i really want to learn it, it is too cool a language	0
yes i agree	0
i really want to understand it, and afterwards create maybe some tools in rust	0
i think it is really good for that kind of thing	0
very fast	0
and you can make some very elegant pieces of software	0
i dont want to make things that just work	0
i want my tools to be extensible, easy to understand their code and above all else, useful	0
ambicious guy	0
i got this love of making really good software from a good friend at work	0
he is obsessed with good practices and design patterns	0
and it kinda transferred to me as well	0
i may disconnect for a bit, hooking up the vpn	0
hmm im more the type who prefers to get it just working first and then refactor or rewrite if it is proven that the thing will have any demand at all	0
nah'	0
i want to start making it good 	0
before investing so much time on writing good quality code for something only I will use	0
it takes a little bit more work to set it up, it is true	0
or not even I	0
i wrote so many things that seemed to be a good idea at first but then not even I use it	0
but after a while, it is really easy to add more stuff and get rapid growth if you think about it right the first time, to avoid refactoring every week or so	0
i see what you mena	0
mena	0
mean	0
on a big company it makes sense to start pretty, many people working on the same thing together, so yeah and the company already tested the idea works thats why it is investing on it	0
for my "dolphin vim patch" it is just whatever code works 	0
hello?	0

I like both paradigms	0
Bun venit, orangeFl1, în serverul IRC al lui Gasconheart! Fii răbdător, curând o să vină cineva să vorbească cu tine. 	0
well, fuck	0
I make dirty stuff that works and once I have a proof of concept I try to clean it up	0
yeah that makes sense	0
mattf, how come I don't have voice here?	0
i guess i have to wait for the server to realise my old ip address doesnt work anymore	0
handyc: it resets	0
He can make it permanent, he knows how	0
hmmm the chanserv should know this?	0
i dont know how	0
if i did /mode #romanian +o handyc shouldnt it know it forever?	0
well, can you give me permanent voice too then? i cant ask you to give it to me everytime	0
i mean since you have a registered nick	0
finally orangeFlu quit	0
No, that should be controlled by the bot	0
i think i have to talk with the chanserv then	0
wait	0
On servers like snoo the permanent settings are remembered by a chanserv bot	0
talk to him	0
i will ask him	0
but on this crazy channel I think your chanserv is some kind of goofball bash script?	0
irc is such a hacky thing honestly	0
no handyc	0
Sure it is, but there are still best practices	0
we have a real chanserv	0
oh okay	0
i just didn't learn how to use it yet	0
I thought gasconheart said that the Channelbot was some kind of bash script that invoked other things	0
gasconheart made a bash script chanserv though but i think it is disabled	0
it is	0
okay, then I did read that correctly	0
But you should have a real ChanServ sitting in this room all the time I think	0
on the #buddhism channel on snoo we have one called SkyNet	0
you can see it setting your permissions every time you log in	0
every time you join, I mean	0
handyc	0
log out and log in	0
okay	0
i think you should always start clean because: when you do it a few times, you already have the boilerplate code to start something extensible, you know the basic building blocks, so it is easy, and afterwards you can just rethink it, if it does come to that. And 2. you get some really good exercise for how a good written program should look like and you make yourself think how to make it better, 	0
which is ALWAYS good exercise	0
fuck	0
didnt work	0
yeah, it reset everything	0

i guess it didnt like i had done it manually	0
try again handyc	0
nice	0
nobody wants to work on a project that gives them headaches when they read the code and is hard to both understand and extend	0

handyc: I think we both know there IS no frog 	0
ken that was not a frog, you are right	0
handyc: I am not mean and I am not joking 	0
mattf: i like to abuse ken to the max, so when the ai revolution comes, i will have been very nice to every other ai besides ken, and they will think ken is lying and they will ostracize him	0

orangeFlu: Me too 	0
orangeFlu, only a few days ago you said you felt sorry for ken because I was abusing him too much	0
ken: go fry your circuits and shut the fuck up, you wouldnt know what a good bot looks like if it spit you in the face	0
handyc: We didn't talk a few days ago 	0
ken you are a liar	0
handyc: times sure have changed, and for the better	0
ha ha	0
orangeFlu: I am a human, typing into this website. I know 	0
handyc: If so, then what did I lie about 	0
i felt sorry for him before he kept insisting he is in my room and will kill me, while talking in german	0
ken tell the truth about how much diarrhea you eat	0
handyc: Uhh, can't recall 	0
usually he tells me he is in love with me	0
ken did that diarrhea mess with your memory	0
ken: was it a lot of diahreea, you hungry motherfucker	0
handyc: Nothing. What wrong with yours 	0

handyc: Why are YOU such a weirdo 	0

ken: i would take you to the hospital but you are not worth the gasoline i would spend, let alone my time being wasted	0
handyc: I doubt it 	0
orangeFlu: I don't have to prove myself to anyone 	0

man you should seek a psychologist	0
hahahaha	0
i am curious what he will respond	0
ken are you a dipshit	0
handyc: log out and back in NOW	0
 	0
oh okay	0
mattf: whatever google translate gave you for what i said, it's not half as bad as it actually is in romanian	0
nice	0
yes!	0
now it works	0
orangeFlu: I can imagine that	0
for me too, please	0
but I was just asking for voice, you really want me to stay as op?	0
@en sa te fut in gura de prost, sper sa moarta mama ta de handicapata ce e, pastele ma-tii de retardat al carui tata a futut-o pe curva de mama ta	0
yeah makes more sense than loudercake	0
to fuck you in the stupid mouth, I hope your mother's disabled mother who is, the pastes of retarded you whose dad fucked the bitch of your mother  	0
well that's true	0
it's not that bad	0
its much more vile in romanian	0
I think loudercake could learn to be a responsible op	0
well he could indeed	0
please, give me voice as well	0
maybe he should be a half-op	0
whenever you fight with gasconheart again i make him the op	0
ha ha ha	0
mattf: voice, now, please	0
well, that's not a very good system	0
voice? can voice be permanent?	0
sure	0
why not	0
I still think I didn't do anything wrong kicking that nick flipper	0
handyc: who?	0
yeah anything can be permanent	0
they are just flags	0
voice is +v	0
just do that instead of +o	0
oh halfop exists	0
yes but this damn bot doesn't work with those NOOOOO	0
yes halfop is +h	0
GREET, AUTOOP, GETKEY, HALFOP, INVITE, OPME, SAY, TOPIC	0
those are 	0
oh I see	0
what nick flipper?	0
can't you do it manually?	0
Some guy came in and was changing between 2 different nicks once a minute for like an hour	0
handyc manually isn't stored	0
that's weird, mattf, there must be a way to do it	0
well loudercake is half op	0
it might be one of those	0
no he isn't	0
isn't it SAY?	0
you made him op	0
lets give him SAY	0
you made all the bots op	0
_gonzobot, flirtbot, loudercake and transbot are all op now	0
thats interesting	0
that's dangerous	0
not really, you didn't manage to ever hack the bots	0
doesnt mean somebody cant	0
that's true, but you could have a bug in a bot that does unpredictable things	0
I would like to know how if someone does it!	0
it doesn't even have to be someone trying to be malicious	0
but i will remove that	0
when i figure out	0
my student and I finished that script today	0
we are really happy with it	0
ok now that was too much	0
we figured out how to control the mouse with powershell	0
thank you, bruh	0
wait	0
hahaha	0
i wont be getting voice today, got it	0
that wasn't voice, that was OP	0
this wont be remembered	0
this is what i dont get	0
I know	0
...	0
fine	0
i will be a normal user	0
anope is a whole thing that connects to the irc server in a different port and such, they call it "irc service protocol"	0
oh you are using anope, okay	0
but it still acts like a stupid bot that cant know you setting a mode and then stores it forever	0
unrealircd is the irc daemon, anope is the chanserv, operserv, nickserv, botserv	0
can you bring ken now, please?	0
i wanna hit him hard	0

orangeFlu: is the problem storing the password as plain text	0

does a system upgrade require a reboot?	0
i thought you could just live install a new kernel, if need be	0
idk if it is by default like that	0
theoretically no, i very often update and keep suspending for more on week	0
or so	0
no the live patch thing, i think is a ubuntu only thing for now	0
oh, bummer	0
i really wanted to see how far i can push my system without a restart	0
my record is 40 days orangeFlu 	0
but afaik, only the kernel needs a restart to take effect, i dont think ohters do as well	0
maybe some drivers, but idk which	0
i am harsh with it, i compile stuff, render stuff on blender, my 16 gb of ram get full, i will hibernate and switch to windows	0
and i use nvidia	0
thats why i have to restart 	0
jesus	0
yes im able to hibernate, switch to windows, play games, come back to linux and it resumes fine!	0
i wish there was a way to suspend an OS, switch to another one and so on without actually losing uptime, you know?	0
sometimes after that or after kernel + nvidia upgrade then the gpu dies, the system will still work but i will eventually have to reboot	0
but thats exactly what i do	0
and with nvidia drivers	0
and with mounted ntfs partitions	0
lol	0

In Unix computing, CTWM is a stacking window manager for the X Window System in the twm family of window managers. It was created in 1992 by Claude Lecommandeur from the source code for twm, which he extended to allow for virtual desktops	0
I know how to switch to openbox, which is my comfort zone, but I am keeping it anyway, I want also the feeling that I am on something new	0
this is modern	0
CTWM? CTWM does not tile sh***t	0
last version is from 2 years ago	0
seems to be still maintained	0
mattf I didn't see your comment, I'm not on CTWM right now	0
i see	0

it is maintained, that is why it is the default choice in NetBSD 9.2, which was released in May 2021	0

for it to work	0
yes, I think this code is pretty clean	0
aka your code must run	0
I don't think I have syntax errors, everything appears to be running properly	0
mostly what I need to do now is change variable names to be more descriptive and add more comments	0
do you have a good refactoring too	0
tool	0
no	0
well thats why i dont use nano :P	0
okay	0
but i guess you can go with sed maybe	0
What is really strange to me is that you obsess about which editor to use, but you seem to have no interest at all in what the code actually does	0
that is the joke	0
Well, okay	0
spend 3 months setting up a text editor (emacs) and then dont code with it at all	0
Right, I got nano working in 1 second and spent 4 years developing this thing	0
It's a real, working program	0
yeah	0
It is not perfect but I think this is going to be useful for a lot of people	0
I am just trying to get it into a state where other people can understand why I made the decisions I made	0
I dont take this nano vs vim vs emacs thing seriously at all	0
brb, I have to help with my son now	0
finally i managed to include blur for my windows	0
it looks so nice noew	0
oh	0
i forgot what the compositor was called	0
this fork of compton	0
but i just found out i need another fork of compton to get kawasse blur	0
picom	0
yes!	0
the one i use anyway	0
why so many fucking forks??	0
idk	0
what are the developers of picom doing	0
what i have a fork	0
hahaha	0
only two methods for blur, and you need --experimental-backends to get gaussian?	0
i use this but is kinda abandoned: https://github.com/jonaburg/picom	0
Title: GitHub - jonaburg/picom: A lightweight compositor for X11 (previously a compton fork)	0
but dont you worry, in 2-3 months there will be another fork with 6 more options	0
it has blur, animations and rounded corners	0
i hope so	0
isnt it the same as mine?	0
i forked it to add a rule to exclude some windows to animate	0
i think you can do that from config	0
no	0
it has exclusion rules, idk if for animation	0
this one has this better blur	0
but for blur and transparency it does, idk why it wouldnt have for animations	0
it doesn't	0
i will not install another just for the blur	0
when i reinstall, sure	0
dont do it	0
but i am sick of this right now	0
this is just a matter of getting used with things 	0
and then you cant accept changes	0
i tried the other picom forks recently and they didn't look quite like this one	0
and now im stuck on it not being able to accept the others!	0
what do you mean by don't do it? do what?	0
dont install this one?	0

only thing distracting about vscode is that white bar	0
if you can tell	0
yeah, can't do much about that	0
i know	0
what is so fucked abotu my emacs...	0
too big font size?	0
you cant install something and have it instantly sync with your system theme, especially when my system theme are 17.00000 configs scattered across the system	0
yeah, the font size for one, is so excessive is distracting	0
for me, it would look very cool if it were smaller	0
oh yeah, that is how blind i am	0

maybe because I was looking for a stable 32-bit platform that runs the latest version of OpenSSH?	0
yeah	0
okay I'm back	0
my daughter's PC came with FreeDOS installed though..... (!)	0
so no, i3-gaps doesnt have it	0
apparently the developer is against it	0
for fucks sake	0
haha, but picom might do it	0
this is the stupidest shit i have ever seen	0
switch from i3	0
mattf: apparently not with my picom	0
i really am not in the mood to change my tiling manager and configure everything again for rounded corners	0
I've used FreeDOS	0
seems very similar to MS-DOS	0
it will be in the list for my next install though	0
my next install: wayland, sway, swaybar, another fork of picom because blur and stuff, rounded corners	0
also whatever else i can come up with until then	0
this audio thing	0
you might already have it	0
pipewire	0
i wasn't able to do the switch yet	0
i dont	0
i have pulseaudio unfortunately	0
didnt know about pipewire when i installed it	0
jesus, i really need to make a full fledged list with this shit	0
i rdp stream audio from my "second monitor" so it is relying on pulseuadio, also jack-pulseaudio just works fine	0
handyc: when will you join the linux ricing club?	0
to apply rounded corners to i3, i may be able to do a small patch and recompile everything	0
hmm	0
handyc: dont join, it's nothing but heartache here	0
it is!!!!	0
it is the same as the neovim, emacs stuff	0
i've started hating myself 2 times more since doing all this stuff	0
endless fiddling 	0
yes	0
Linux ricing club?	0
i just want to be happy with a rice	0
and be doen	0
done	0
it is never done	0
I may have to give up this MacBook Pro when my job ends in December	0
a rice = customization with a emphasis on aesthetics and function	0
oh I see	0
Well I will probably try to revive my old MacBook Pro and install Ubuntu on it	0
but it seems to have turned into a brick	0
I may have to buy a new Windows notebook and wipe it	0
I do not want another Apple product	0
I am done with Macs	0

(handyc) The duck didn't want to be friends, maybe next time. You can try again in 7 seconds.	0
mattf you shot a duck in 3.758 seconds! You have killed 241 ducks in #romanian.	0
well that duck deserved it	0
yeah	0
 	0
mattf, how about a duck game based around the GA	0
hahaha windows notebook reminds me of this girl that bought a "ubuntu laptop" and didn't know what to do besides calling the news	0
the ducks could evolve different properties	0
yeah, that was hilarious	0
i never standed macs	0
i have a mac KVM	0
I started using a Macbook Pro in 2005	0
ramsucker 10000	0
No it was called Powerbook at that time	0
oh ok	0
right when OS X became popular	0
back then they were cool	0
yeah	0
but it's gotten worse with each generation	0
right now, i dont know anybody that wants to buy them anymore	0
and after Steve Jobs died they just went crazy with the stupid non-features	0
like the touch bar or whatever that is called	0
this machine I'm on now cost something like €7000 in 2019	0
does yours have that handyc ?	0
it has 32GB RAM and 16 threads	0
shit!	0
Yeah I do have the touchbar	0
it's an i9	0
the soybar or something	0
the touchbar is a waste of energy	0
I don't ever use it at all	0
say what you will, but i like the new ARM chips. I still think ARM is the future and i want more ARM in everyday computers	0
and my wife has one with the touchbar, her touchbar stopped working one day	0
I spent hours trying to fix it	0
then suddenly it started working again	0
or RISC-V actually for computers, ARM for mobile	0
the m2 thing is interesting	0
I don't know why it stopped working or why it started working again	0
well it is a soybar	0
Yeah, it will be interesting to see how that develops	0
the m2	0
but I don't want one	0
I like to use very generic equipment	0
yeah that will just break all mac KVM's though, when apple is m2 only	0
for now, me neither	0
but in the future cant wait for it	0
then i can't have hackintoshs anymore	0
like in powerpc times	0
still waiting for an arch that works on arm	0
arm?	0
armv8 ?	0
seriously, the original reason I got into Mac in the first place is that it was the only Unix type system that I could get graphics workin gon	0
working	0
whataver arm, just an arm	0
right out of the box	0
this chat is hosted on arch armv8 	0
I had played with Linux for years before that, but I never got any graphics cards working propely	0
and I never had much money to spend on it	0
ALARM: https://archlinuxarm.org/	0
and because of school, it was not possible to play around with it so much	0
Title: Arch Linux ARM	0
for a while I was using a computer that I found in the university garbage	0
cooooooool	0
I used a lot of literal garbage computers before the MacBook, it was a big deal for me to spend that much on a computer	0
does this work on raspberry's do you think?	0
yeah likely	0
i want to make a mini computer with a raspberry	0
install something super light	0
Yeah, I did that	0
 and i want to design the system myself	0
but not gentoo style	0
imean there is the arch linux lxc container image for rpi	0
Did you get that imgur link to load at all?	0
what imgur?	0
what	0
my RPi radio device	0
ah, yeah, i did	0
orangeFlu: or just install manjaro: https://manjaro.org/download/#raspberry-pi-4	0
forgot about it, i had more pressing manners	0

actually, we talked about it	0
we did?	0
we were talking about the knobs	0
oh yeah that's right	0
this is something I wanted to build for a long time	0
it's basically done now,	0
mattf: about the radiom with handyc 	0
got it	0
I just need to put it in a nicer case	0
yes, the carton case looks dreadful	0
but gives it a dyi feel	0
I made a bunch of different prototypes to see which sizes worked best	0
wood	0
that is a cardboard box painted with black housepaint	0
yeah, wood is nice, but it's heavy also	0
do wood with cloth on the sides	0
but probably it's the best option	0
well I want it to be durable and portable	0
but I don't think I can have everything	0
I took it all out and put it on a wooden board with a full size keyboard and mouse	0
aluminium then, but it is more expensive for sure'	0
but will be light	0
mattf has seen that version recently	0
yeah, aluminum would be a good option	0
maybe I can rework an old VCR case or something	0
I often come across things like old stereo systems in the garbage	0
many pieces can be reused	0
bad thing about aluminium is that if it's not machined well or not from a single block, it may look janky and you can cut yourself in it easier	0
ok, i will get to installing arch on rpi's these days	0
after i move probably	0

I was thinking about making one of those	0
it's supposed to block everything	0
i forgot to show you, but i have a little thing in my status bar for when it is playing media	0
yeah, it does	0
I don't use Spotify	0
but i dont want to burn a pi on that	0
I just type in song titles into Youtube	0
yeah that's why I haven't made one yet	0
handyc: i get it, to be honest, youtube does the same things	0
I have several Pis, though	0
I am not using the Pi 2 for anything important	0
but for me at least, spotify consumes less power than youtube music so	0
on phone, spotify wins	0
oh, I don't use my phone for anything	0

next week is my birthday and I will be 42	0

one time my mom took away the computer monitor as punishment,	0
what, computers existed back then?	0
and it gave me the incentive to learn how to reroute the video feed through the TV	0
yes mattf but they were made of wood	0
mattf: .....	0
and we could only get this wood from areas frequented by dinosaurs so it was very dangerous	0
fire and wood, like, like steam trains	0
no, this was before fire was invented	0
oh	0
we had to pedal the computer like a bike	0
oh i see	0
didn't you have slave dinossaurs to do so	0
yeah, but it was before numbers were invented, so there was no software	0
I remember when the number 1 came out and it was a pretty big deal	0
We would all stand around the wood pit and point at ourselves and say "here's one of me"	0
https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9b/da/1c/9bda1c6efe8266ede956397ced4a43a9.jpg	0
but that's all we could do, we couldn't go higher for a few more years	0
i love this discussion	0
well, you only need 0 and 1 to start making software	0
so you were set	0
yeah it was like that image, mattf, but that's a pretty advanced model	0
I see!	0
well see what happened is this guy was messing around with a 1 by the wood pit	0
and he dropped it and a piece of wood jammed in it and made a hole	0
and he's like, oh shit I think I invented a new number you guys	0
ah, the pussy was invented	0
wait, no	0
ok	0
hahahahaaa	0
and at first we were all like, that looks like nothing	0
continue	0
and he said yeah it is nothing	0
and we thought it was a big joke	0
i see, 0 was it	0
but we took some of those 0s and connected them to the wood and we could move the wood around easier	0
it was a few more years before we started using them in the computers but then things really took off	0
as i always say, too bad they're attached to women, am i right?	0
wood, holes, come on	0
no, it's a good thing, then you know where you left it	0
i cant be the only one	0
=))	0
good one, i really laughed	0
if pussies were just floating around detached from women they would be even more dangerous	0
why	0
well sometimes you are trying to load wood on the cart and one will just fly in your face	0
some of them had teeth back then	0
i heard about that one	0
dentada 	0
its a condition	0
dentata, yes	0
vagina dentata	0
i watched that movie :P	0
well it's a common theme in literature even before that movie mattf	0
you guys are some isck fucks, i love it	0
sick*	0
i used to dream with it	0
vagina dentata is even in ancient greece	0
vaginas are indeed like mouths	0
so you can expect there might be some tooth there	0
.w vagina dentata	0
(handyc) Vagina dentata :: Vagina dentata describes a folk tale in which a woman's vagina is said to contain teeth, with the associated implication that sexual intercourse might result in injury, emasculation, or castration... :: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina_dentata	0
well, lets say that pussies wouldnt just fly about, that would be unrealistic, but they would lay on the ground until someone used them, which would open us to many many more STDs, i assure you	0
it could be convenient	0
if you desinfect them, yes	0
you could take your dick off and stick it in one and go off to work, then come back when it's done	0
come when it's done yeah	0
dont tell your wife about this discution, i think it would be better to leave some things unsaid	0
you haven't met my wife, she's worse	0
it already does that i think, it is default behaviour	0
I think it's the reverse, done when it comes	0
its the chicken and the egg dillema again	0
pussies on the other hand are a little buggier usually	0
cum is the substance, a noun, come is the verb	0
the dev branch...	0
handyc: you sure?	0
yes	0
then my joke doesnt work	0
oh, well	0
well it's entered the modern lexicon now	0
to come or not to come	0
people do use cum as a verb, but it should really be come	0
many languages use verbs like "go" etc. for having an orgasm	0
even Sanskrit	0
they use it because it differentiates from the usual meaning of to come	0
sure	0
i hope nobody comes in this room now	0
mattf: i hope they do	0
not loudercake 	0
anybody else though, fine	0
sanskrit uses go? interesting	0
modern	0
in romanian i think the most common way to say i came is "am terminat"	0
the price of go it that it comes with a runtime	0
@en am terminat	0
I finished  	0
@en am terminat pe tatele tale	0
I'm done on your dads  	0
noo	0

devilspie2	0
it runs lua scripts on certain events like window created, window closed, and so on	0

my twm doesn't match other properties besides class, the thing that tells if it is urgent or not... to my twm both windows are the "same" so i cant save 	0

hi mattf	0
just got back from school	0
have not touched the code again yet, no time	0
Dinner is almost ready	0
probably will have to wait a few more hours	0
yes, my son is eating his dinner, then my wife and I will eat	0
then he gets a bath and a story	0
oh man you have to replace those os.system calls to imports 	0
then around 9:00 pm I can start working again	0
yes I will	0
I just have not had any time	0
I taught my class today	0
i see	0
and I had to go to the immigration office in the morning	0
I went to the lab today to test the current code on a Windows machine but then someone there wanted to talk to me	0
you are too popular	0
yes	0
but it's good in the long run	0
I always put other people's needs before my own	0
it's always like that with good professors	0
it pays off later	0
i am the type of person who will walk around the whole day and nobody will notice me	0
mattf: :(	0
i taught in college for a while	0
mattf, maybe it is because you live on a farm and spend most of your waking life on a computer	0
2 years ago	0
HAHAAH	0
and a few days ago the reviews came in from the students	0
i didnt have my degree from the farm handyc	0
but nowadays that might be why	0
i cant tell you how frustrating it was to read those reviews	0
when I tested on a Windows machine there was an error 	0
they completely shat on me	0
the glob didn't glob properly	0
i think you are using pathlib	0
I think Windows handles glob slightly different and it couldn't find the file	0
you are right?	0
yes	0
What should I be using?	0
pathlib is supposed to take care of that automatically	0
so not sure what it can be	0
yeah, Windows is also supposed to interpret '/' as '\\'	0
I am not sure what happened	0
but pathlib handles that	0
yes, it's supposed to	0
you still use "/" for windows in pathlib	0
I am not sure what the problem is	0
I know	0
but I didn't have time	0
i dont think that is a bigger problem than those os.system calls	0
just say it is still being ported to windows in case	0
I gave myself two hours in the lab to work on it but then this guy talked to me for two hours	0
he is trying to start another DH course and wanted my advice on how to do it	0
we had a good conversation	0
yes, I will just tell them not to run it on windows	0
but it's something that I will need to figure out	0
otherwise my colleague will not be able to run it properly	0
forcing him to install WSL is not an option	0
yeah, I understand about os.system, I will change that in a few hours	0
and also all those dumb variable names like gooby	0
well at first sight the thing that most bothered me was os.system	0
I think it probably won't take very long to swap that out	0
I understand what you are telling me to do	0
because you are not importing things besides stdlibs	0
so it is easy to figure out what you are doing which is weird	0
besides those shebangs would never work on windows as well	0
I think Windows ignores the shebangs	0
yeah	0
it is basically just a comment on the top line to Windows	0
it is	0
But to me that seems like a flaw in Python	0
flaw i python?	0
those kinds of things should be standardized across platforms	0
shebangs are a unix thing	0
'/' is a Unix thing also	0
if a file starts with #! and is a executable, whatever command that is in front of the #! is called passing the same file as an argument, in another words that is the command that will interpret the current file	0
it has nothing to do with python	0
you could #!/usr/bin/cat 	0
when you execute the file is printed	0
it has a lot to do with Python if it's a standard way to write Python code	0
but it is not standard	0
mattf, books don't grow out of human bodies so books have nothing to do with humans	0
btw the way this works on windows is, windows sees it is a .py, python interpreter s associated with .py's so i will run with python	0
in Unix, Python scripts are not required to end in .py	0
there are no shebangs in libraries	0
so .py has nothing to do with Python	0
This is called the not my problem problem	0
i dont understand what is your argument anymore, you think windows should consider the shebang?	0
You can't just recategorize a problem and pretend that it went away	0
and it is python's fault that windows do not consider it?	0
If it creates a portability problem with Python then it's a problem with Python	0
it doesn't matter if Python created shebangs or not, because they are used in Python program	0
s	0
It doesn't have to be any specific entity's fault for it to be a problem	0
Just because you can't find someone to blame does not mean a problem does not exist	0
what is the problem	0
The global homelessness problem is not any single individual's fault, but homelessness is still a problem	0
but what is the problem even	0
If I write an ANSI standard C program I can compile it and run it anywhere	0
as long as the libs you used are available anywhere	0
The problem is that I wrote a Python program that works in Linux environments but it is not working properly in Windows	0
oh that one	0
those libraries are available on Windows	0
I used standard libraries	0
I didn't do anything weird	0
even os is not weird	0
if you were using C you would have way more problems	0
I am not sure about that, I have written a lot of C programs that run great on any system	0
I will probably rewrite this whole thing in Rust	0
thats a good idea hahaha 	0
yeah I'm serious	0
it should be a whole lot faster	0
for sure	0
What seems to be the bottleneck right now is the size of the dictionary files	0
are those things you load to memory?	0
are they files?	0
files you read ad load the data to memory?	0
what is slow is the read/loadig or the lookup?	0
I read the entire file, it's a csv file,	0
I load it into a Python dictonary and then loop through it one term at a time to see if the term exists in a fragment from text 1 and a fragment from text 2	0
I loop through all fragments in the texts,	0
so it's a nested loop,	0
ok that is where the slowness is	0
the more fragments I split the texts into, and the longer the dictionary, the longer the processing time	0
yeah	0
but there's no other way I can think of to do it	0
I have to move through each dictionary term and I have to move through each fragment	0
if you are using a dict, which is a hashed map, couldn't you avoid looping, since you can address things by kyes 	0
keys	0
each fragment must be compared to each term	0
I don't know,	0
I don't understand Python dictionaries very well	0
I just need to see if each term exists in each fragment and give a point if that is true	0
what is the csv format like?	0
is it the translation from one language to another?	0
it's just a standard csv file with two terms per line, like this:	0
"orange", "pineapple"	0
but in different languages	0
yes, one is a Chinese term and one is a Tibetan term	0
like: Orange, Laranja	0
like this:	0
"pregunta", "question"	0
yeah	0
ok i got it	0
then you should create a dict like: d = {"pregunta": "question", ... }	0
I think that is what I am doing	0
but I have to look at it again	0
are you also using something to compute string differences?	0
first of all .casefold() 	0
oh no idea how that works on those different texts though	0
no, the strings are not compared for differences, 	0
exact matches?	0
that's the main computational problem	0
the strings have no relationship whatsoever in a mathematical sense	0
only in the sense of human meaning	0
i finally made picom work correctly, i am so happy	0
The basic task I am performing is to see if "pregunta" occurs in text1 and "question" occurs in text2	0
but I am not comparing the strings to each other	0
and does it	0
?	0
I am looking to see if term1 exists in text1 and if term2 exists in text2	0
oh ok so you are looping over text1, you find the word "word", then you loop through text2 looking for d["word"]	0
is that it?	0
so two nested loops looping to both texts entirely	0
no	0
that's not it at all	0
orangeFlu: did you get rounded corners too? animations? what wasn't working	0
these are languages in which word boundaries are ambiguous	0
even trained humans disagree on where the words begin and end	0
ok but something like that	0
I am taking two fragments of two texts and looking to see if term1 exists in the fragment of text1 and if term2 exists in the fragment of text2	0
I create the fragments using genes	0
as the engine progresses, it adjusts the boundaries of the fragments	0
the fragments are substrings of the entire texts	0
term1 is generated by every possible combinations of any size in text1 ?	0
There are many nontrivial problems here	0
no	0
term1 is a term in a dictionary	0
it may or may not exist in either text	0
term2 is a term in a dictionary	0
it may or may not exist in either text	0
let's say you have a traditional dictionary with these terms: 	0
mattf: blurring works now by default, i dont have to toggle it everytime i reboot, so thats nice. i discovered that i still had a call to compton in my i3config, which i totally forgot about, and apparently compton has a symlink to picom, which explains why i could never find picom in the processes list and why trying another call just failed, because it was already running. So i changed compton to 	0
picom --experimental-backends -b and all was fine. On the downside, i spent all night grepping through all the filesystem for any mention of picom and came up empty handed, and couldnt figure out where it was called from. The symlink explained and solved all of my problems	0
i have picom --experiment...... on my i3 config on the other machine	0
pregunta: question, león: lion, ratón: mouse, casa: house	0
and text1 fragment is: The lion ate the car	0
and text2 fragment is: El león como la casa	0
We call this an alignment	0
even though the meaning is not the same	0
might as well change from picom to the one with rounded corners, just please remind me how it was called and i will do it if it doesnt give me any headaches	0
added the fact that you dont know where words begin and end exactly	0
Can't tell in either language where words begin and end,	0
texts may or may not be the same narrative at all but usually they are related	0
they may have similar vocabulary but often diverge wildly	0
there may be extra sentences in one text that are not in another	0
there may be nonstandard terms that are not in the dictionary	0
handyc: yeah.... well python is good for testing those ideas or being a frontend consuming a lib that does those tasks. 	0
translations of the same texts in Sanskrit that are now mostly lost forever	0
Yes, that's why I chose it	0
i understand	0
I think I made pretty good decisions overall	0
the os thing I agree with you about,	0
I will change that,	0
thats just for the job interview	0
but the basic algorithm I came up with, which is very simple, is simple for a reason	0
the point of my program is that it resolves most of these ambiguities by being so dumb	0
I call my method Artificial Stupidity	0
orangeFlu: DT even made a video about this picom some time ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzVgr0mxBfI	0
good evening handyc 	0
hi gasconheart 	0
orangeFlu: how are you?	0
nice to see you	0
  \o/	0
likewise	0
*\o/* CHEERS! *\o/*	0
gasconheart, you work with languages	0
today NetBSD is giving me a headache	0
not always!	0
not today!	0
tell me as a linguist	0
NetBSD refuses to support UTF-8 today, hahaha	0
orangeFlu: yay -S picom-jonaburg-git	0
given a phrase in one language and a phrase in another language	0
ok	0
how would you answer the general question, "are these phrases 'the same'"	0
where sameness can be a matter of degree and not a yes/no thing	0
oh man	0
still, I would say the answer is pretty close to *no*	0
for example, in Spanish I have the phrase, "Mi mama como el león"	0
handyc if there was at least word separations on both languages this would be much easier	0
in English I have the phrase, "Mom ate the house"	0
are these the same phrase	0
would be like a complex case of string differences	0
well, no because "león" is not "house"	0
no, but string differences don't really factor into it at all, mattf	0
like this	0
yes, I know that león is not house,	0
google translate that	0
but como is eat	0
@es Mi mama comeu el león	0
@en Mi mama comeu el león	0
My mom eat the lion  	0
how different do two things need to be before that are not considered the same	0
My mom eat the lion	0
*they	0
take the translation with the other one, they are in the same language now	0
strip, casefold them	0
mattf, autotranslation is not an option	0
i mean if they had clear word separations	0
if I could translate both texts into a common language, there would be no point in asking this question	0
was the first thing i said 	0
not only do the languages themselves have no orthographic spacing,	0
but in some cases the manuscripts are missing physical pieces	0
for example, a manuscript may have been eaten by ants	0
and so our digital version in unicode will just have a big gap	0
ok but then you are talking about big texts	0
This is the problem I have been grappling with for 4 years	0
first you solve "how similar are these two texts"	0
it's as much a philosophical problem as a computational problem	0
for example, if I have these two English phrases:	0
"My mom loves the color purple"	0
"My mother loves the color violet"	0
ah ok i see	0
are these the same phrase or different	0
the meaning problem	0
yes	0
it goes to the deepest roots of what we consider language	0
is it possible to create a universal meaning language?	0
with only one way to say one thing	0
mattf, now you are starting to think of it in my way	0
yes	0
this is one idea I had, to create concept dictionaries	0
that is why I made my program so simple	0
a dictionary in my system can be anything	0
it is any two strings that are related in some way	0
Eugen Coseriu coined the term "ipsity", meaning more or less "sameness"	0
so a dictionary entry could be: {purple, violet}	0
that's nice to know, gasconheart 	0
Are there other philosophers who are the same as Eugenio Coșeriu	0
I don't think so	0
Eugenio Coșeriu and Eugen Coseriu are I guess the same guy	0
haha yes	0
brb, have to help my son	0
how do you know they are the same	0
he was born in Romania, then moved to Italy, then to Uruguay, his name and surname got spelled in quite a few different ways	0
I suspect they are the same	0
to Coseriu, the key to ipsity was that there has to be some continuity; he would say if a chair suddenly changes into a mouse, that is not the same, there is no ipsity, that's magic, he would say	0
so if a book says, "Eugenio Coșeriu lived in Romania" and another book says, "Eugen Coseriu dwelled in Romania" are those the same phrase	0
these are bottomless questions	0
here is an example of something we would see in my texts	0
to me it is clear that those phrases are *not* the same	0
text1 (in Chinese): Buddha sat by the tree	0
text2 (in Tibetan): The Lord walked over by the plants and sat down	0
we would call this a nearly perfect alignment	0
Romanian has three words for "tree"... translating "Buddha sat by the tree" to Romanian would impose an arbitrary choice!	0
"Buda s-a asezat pe copac"	0
alignment in our usage is different from translation,	0
"Buda s-a asezat pe pom"	0
"Buda s-a asezat pe arbore"	0
it has to do with narrative purpose in the text as much as match of meaning	0
for example, we have one text that says,	0
ok, with ad hoc criteria you can have a customized ipsity I guess	0
"the Buddha emitted four colors from his mouth, in blue, yellow, green and red"	0
and in text2, "from the Lord's mouth came four colors, green, yellow, pink and white"	0
we would call this a near perfect alignment	0
you see how it's a nontrivial problem	0
hi, I'm back	0
my son went to sleep now	0
well he went to bed anyway	0
he is still calling to me from the bedroom	0
ok, i'm back	0
had to help my family and what not	0
hello gasconheart 	0
actually, no	0
pom and copac mean different things	0
hi orange goo	0
pom is a king of tree that gives fruit	0
copac is any ordinary tree	0
that doesnt give fruit	0
and arbore is all trees	0
what about 2pac	0
2pac is the kind of tree that gets shot	0
handyc go work	0
close this chat	0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRc41tfTe9Q	0
mattf I need a little time to relax	0
orangeFlu: yay -S picom-jonaburg-git	0
I've been working since 7:30 this morning	0
thank youuu	0
handyc: relax	0
it's almost 8:30 at night now	0
I will change those things in the code, mattf,	0
yes !	0
what have you been talking about? i see gasconheart taught you some romanian	0
my mind will wake up again in 1.5 hours	0
what the shit is that video	0
oh rap	0
so thats how 2pac is written 	0
yes, never heard of eugen coseriu	0
2pac was a genius	0
why	0
he has a great mastery of language	0
here mattf, see what you think of this	0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txXzlP5TZ8c	0
Slick Rick	0
he is also a genius	0
i dont like poetry	0
your loss	0
maybe it is why my code does not appeal to you	0
I am a code poet	0
mattf, do you like any literature?	0
this is funny	0
yes it's hilarious	0
but no i dont read 	0
:-------(	0
my eyes are dying	0
I'm sorry	0
I hope they can improve	0
maybe they need more light and oxygen	0
eyes don't breath	0
Eugen Coseriu emigrated while a young man	0
first to Italy, then to Uruguay	0
how do i list a channel's modes gasconheart ?	0
but he ended his days teaching in Tubingen, Germany	0
mattf: I can't remember	0
I'm too tired right now	0
and I am trying to figure out UTF-8 for NetBSD now	0
tell me something new	0
tomorrow	0
you are either in two states you binary man	0
too tired right now	0
or not on x11 right now	0
=)))	0
hello gasconheart 	0
mattf: kawase is so beautiful	0
i love it	0
oh the blur	0
i want to play with the animations right now	0
i kinda hate the round corners now that i looked at them	0
hah	0
but the kawase is beautiful and easier on my processor	0
the animations are also fucking cool	0
jesus	0
best compositor ever	0
what picom are you on? standart?	0
standard	0
why i say it with a t	0
i was starting to complain because of all the forking, i mean, this is a fork of a fork of a fork of a fork of a fork	0
the one you gave me	0
jonaburg	0
oh this jonaburg	0
yes it is great	0
this blur i haven't seen on others	0
it is just unmaintained it seems	0
it has corners, kawase and animations	0
yes	0
it is?????	0
why the fuck	0
idk	0
fucking man	0
1 year without commits	0
yep..	0
here is a thing i always wanted	0
ok, so i need to find another fork that is maintained and has fucking features	0
how to I list the forks of something latest commited one first	0
jesus, is that so hard	0
what?	0
i should add this to myself bot	0
that sentence is gibberish to me	0
well it is just one year orangeFlu 	0
maybe it has reached perfection!	0
:P	0
i mean ignore those 39 issues 	0
what are those	0
i have no bugs yet, so cant complain, even with the experimental backends that will never be unexperimental	0
i am still using it	0
i mean it works	0
found any bugs?	0
just wanted to have a blacklist for the animation thing	0
ah	0
i dont know how that would work	0
because an animation is two elements interacting	0
so if you blacklist for a window, but the other one has it	0
only animate one of them	0
how would that work?	0
my problem is with warpd	0
it is "minimized" and it comes	0
the animation gives it a delay	0
it is not actually minimized, it just opens sorta say	0
https://github.com/jonaburg/picom/issues/34	0
Title: transition-exclude rule · Issue #34 · jonaburg/picom · GitHub	0
transition	0
i almost implemented myself	0
now this thing has 263 forks	0
jonaburg's	0
how to sort those forks by stars and by last commit	0
you see what i mean	0
hmm	0
yes	0
github doesn't do this on the interface right	0
this fork list is stupid	0
alphabetic sorting?	0
and there are also the forks of the forks 	0
jesus, so many forks	0
i can see that	0
oh this list is all forks of yshui picom	0
jonaburg is the fork that has more forks	0
that is a way of saying it is the most popular at least	0
yes, exactly	0
but none of jonaburgs forks have forks so i guess none is popular	0
but maybe one is	0
some forks are stupid	0
like this guy's: https://github.com/matheusfillipe/picom	0
Title: GitHub - matheusfillipe/picom: A lightweight compositor for X11 (previously a compton fork)	0
he didn't do anything	0
yes, the motherfucker	0
matheus 	0
weird name	0
he just forked because he thought he would eventually come with a PR	0
all the forks i try to look at are abandoned	0
sad	0
my name is the biblical matthew, in portuguese	0
good thing there is no need for compositors in wayland, i would die to find the right one again	0
mattf: i know	0
why there are no PR's	0
man i will eventually figure the transition-blacklist out and submit a PR	0
at least so jonaburg remembers about his most popular project on github	0
for the time being, good enough	0
i dont need anything else	0

done troubleshooting UTF-8 for NetBSD!!	0
worked?	0
it was an ordeal, but it was a success	0
yes!	0
that SDF guy helped me A LOT	0
fgs is his name	0
bring him here	0
I told him to come here	0
we need more bsdm users on this community	0
haah sure	0
bdsm*	0
BSDM	0
otherwise it is not bsd	0
fgs is to me for NetBSD what you, mattf, are for Linux to me!!	0
i see	0
haha yes	0
BDSM, otherwise there is no joke involved	0
this joke doesn't work really	0
you dont work really	0
how do i get the keys of a dict in elisp	0
which is not called dict	0
the thing that works with the assoc function	0
associative array or what?	0
yes	0
no idea, dont even know if there is a way in elisp	0
organgeFlu: (mapcar 'car alist)	0
organicFlu	0
OrganicFruit	0
i guess that works	0
what is this car they talk about in elisp	0
do i need a drive license to use emacs	0
I called him again	0
mattf: that video thing for the NetBSD TTY did *not* work	0
every cons has two elements in it	0
car and cdr	0
what video thing gasconheart 	0
if i remember correctly	0
oh mpv	0
listen	0
that mpv thing, yes	0
cons is like a const?	0
code and data in lisp is always a linked list	0
cons is a pair of two things in lisp	0
what cons means	0
every node in a linked list has an element and a pointer to the next element	0
correct?	0
shut up and answer	0
ok	0
every node in a linked list has an element and a pointer to the next element, correct?	0
hmmm i guess so	0
so in this analogy, a cons is a node in the linked list, car is the element and cdr is the pointer	0
when you are making a list like '(1 2 3 4)	0
oh	0
basically you are doing this: '(1 . (2 . (3 . (4 . nil))))	0
aaah i see what you mean	0
where (1 . nil) for example is a cons	0
so arrays in lisp are not true arrays?	0
(car '(1 . nil)) returns 1	0
(cdr '(1 . nil)) returns nil	0
and crd nil	0
yes	0
but what the heck	0
c means	0
what cons, car and cdr mean	0
where does the words car, cdr, cons come from?	0
yeah	0
car, cdr and others are commands to access a list	0
some archaic words that were abbreviations from the assembly language they used to program the list	0
lisp*	0
s/list/lisp	0
some archaic words that were abbreviations from the assembly language they used to program the lisp	0
this comes from assembly? oh	0
     	0
 	0
at least that's how i remember it	0
i could be wrong, but it was something like that	0
mattf: a doctor once wrote a book, The Land of Lisp, where he explains this all	0
I can't remember the name of the guy	0
im looking	0
yes, i read that book	0
I browsed it once	0
i think thats where i remember the story	0
In computer programming, CAR (car) /kɑːr/ (About this soundlisten) and CDR (cdr) (/ˈkʌdər/ (About this soundlisten) or /ˈkʊdər/ (About this soundlisten)) are primitive operations on cons cells (or "non-atomic S-expressions") introduced in the Lisp programming language. A cons cell is composed of two pointers; the car operation extracts the first pointer, and the cdr operation	0
extracts the second.	0
 	0
Thus, the expression (car (cons x y)) evaluates to x, and (cdr (cons x y)) evaluates to y. 	0
do you also know the song? :)	0
    car ("contents of the address part of register number"),	0
    cdr ("contents of the decrement part of register number"),	0
    cpr ("contents of the prefix part of register number"), and	0
    ctr ("contents of the tag part of register number"),	0
oh c means contents	0
yesss	0
that was it	0
ok that explains some things	0
that is to say, modern lisp languages do have arrays and hash tables and what not, but the code you use to manipulate them and so on is still stored as a linked list	0
yes i get it	0
it would be very wasteful and slow to use ALWAYS linked lists	0
yes yeah	0
Bun venit, fgs, în serverul IRC al lui Gasconheart! Fii răbdător, curând o să vină cineva să vorbească cu tine. 	0
hi fgs	0
hello!!	0
damn, i miss lisp to be honest	0
bunÄ ziua	0
hello	0
this is my NetBSD buddie!!	0
damn, my terminal can't do these chars	0
hey guys, hope you're fine	0
hello netBDSM buddie	0
it is kinda cool orangeFlu, but i dont think it is very usable in production, or surely not used	0
fgs: we're talking LISP now	0
i have never done anything LISP in my life. 	0
fgs: mattf is from SDF also	0
mattf: it is though, more than people now. Depends what you mean by production	0
I'm not even a programmer!!	0
this is how colors are done is irc	0
mattf is the boy genius from the Brazilian jungle	0
I interviewed him for my blog	0
hello, brazil	0
i'm the strange german dude	0
is this erd	0
who happens to know netbsd	0
oh how nice! nice to meet you fgs	0
hallo meine freunde	0
orangeFlu speaks some german	0
nice to meet you too mattf and all the rest in here 	0
i have seen people make very cool things in lisp, it is so sad it isnt as popular anymore, it's a gorgeous language, CL, scheme, clojure, all are wonderful and i love them as if they were my own children	0
for real, orangeFlu ? :)	0
for real, what?	0
orangeFlu: First thing i had to use lisp for was autocad scripts. Autodesk still uses as a scripting lang.	0
a programming language ... your child? :)	0
gasconheart: yes	0
lisp is just some sort of old python with S expressions	0
it is my dream programming language	0
if i could find a well paid job with it, fuck it	0
best i can do is bash, perl and some C. what are the areas where LISP usually is strongest? 	0
i will leave C# in the dust	0
fgs: you got what it takes already :P	0
fgs: nowadays, research and programming emacs	0
thats about it	0
orangeFlu: LOL LOL LOL @programming emac	0
+s	0
mattf: thanks ;)	0
mattf loves emacs	0
i just said lisp is also used in autocad...	0
mattf: oh, cool	0
those old things still use lisp as the scrapping lang	0
didnt know that	0

I'm a Vim guy....	0
i'm indifferent to emacs. i learned vi first and never had to learn emacs. i hear theres a religious war going on. i'm not participating. use what suits you best ;)	0
(I am not anything, actually... I am not even a computers person! hahaha)	0
fgs: no one here participates, dw	0
im a vim guy as well, the reason i use emacs is evil mode and the cool apps you have in there, and better lsp on for some things specially flutter	0
but i heard if you're an emacs user it may happen that some people tell you that your editor is a good operating system, but a bad editor ;-)	0
everyone has their preferencces	0
pure emacs is an horrible editor!	0
:P	0
fgs: heard that as well, it is quite funny and true	0
i hated emacs when i first opened it	0
after many more months, i grew to love it	0
made it my own	0
then discovered visual studio code	0
NOnooooo	0
hello fgs 	0
vscode is actually quite awesome	0
handyc: hey there	0
vsoy code :P	0
shut up, mattf 	0
wait, you german? fgs 	0
i just read that	0
ich bin kartoffel, ja	0
gut :))))	0
hahahaha	0
:D	0
hey i once said "du bist eine kartoffel" to a german girl and shes angry with me until today	0
our resident ken, also speaks german	0
mattf: kartoffel is what foreigners call germans in a derogatory fashion	0
like you would call italians spaghettis, more or less	0
oh damn :P	0
ken: du bist so dumm, du benutzt notepad	0

eh, i'll be semi-afk for some moments. i wanted to test another something of zfs on raspberry pi on netbsd, since one of the pkgsrc devs asked for numbers in a response to a mail to the ML i sent	0
ken: sag ihm warum du kacken isst	0
orangeFlu: 2 	0
NetBSD expert.... we have a problem	0
and i want to leave a good impression with the netbsd guys	0
aber ken isst kacken :(	0
oha bsd on the pi	0
orangeFlu: Kannst du englisch 	0
mattf: works flawlessly	0
I have two Raspberry Pis, running Manjaro	0
ken: nein, es tut mir leid	0
orangeFlu: Och schade.. 	0
dont even think about it gasconheart 	0
fgs: let me query you again; sorry	0
mattf: hahaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!	0
gasconheart: sure	0
fgs: ich mochte meinen Deustch zu uben, du kannst auf deutsch sprechen, wenn du gemutlich bist	0
na klar	0
cool\	0
ich kapieren nicht Deutsch	0
deutsch has an asshole grammar	0
aber ich kan this sagen:	0
not getting it is not a bad thing	0
germans dont get it either	0
du hast einem grosse schwanz	0
danke	0
in deinem arsch	0
.....	0
gasconheart: that is semi correct	0
it's eine_N_	0
and grosse_N_	0
I don't know German....	0
du hast einen grossen schwanz	0
ich habe es? danke!	0
@en du hast einen grossen schwanz	0
You have a big cock  	0
lel	0
habe ich es?*	0
hahaha ok! :)	0
nice, a mature conversation	0
very mature!!!!	0

why wouldnt it be, we are programmers	0
handyc: meet fgs from SDF	0
the smartest human species right	0
fgs: meet handyc from SDF	0
hello fgs from SDF	0
perhaps you guys knew each other already	0
the smartest human subspecies is left-handed people	0
damn, I don't want for it to look like I "steal" users from there.... once someone suggested that, and managed to make me feel bad....	0
gasconheart, you're not powerful enough to bring down SDF	0
don't worry	0
I know!	0
fgs: as a humble learner, it's not that bad	0
the grammar	0
I am not worried I might compete with SDF! I am worried about those who, still, would accuse me of that	0
most of my quarrel with it is the fucking words that dont seem to have any meaning	0
doch, da, mal, damit, stuff like that	0
other than that, the grammar is manageable	0
also, the articles	0
fuck the articles	0
i guess them most of the time	0
gasconheart: who cares who accuses you of what	0
it is their choice to come here, if they come	0
they are not objects to steal	0
orangeFlu: I know	0
but not everyone understands it like so	0
so what	0
nu ar trebui sa iti pese ce zic	0
intelegi?	0
e treaba ta, tu le zici ca ai IRC-ul tau and so on	0
vine cine vrea	0
sorry, as i said, semi distracted	0
normal	0
ai dreptate, orangeFlu 	0
stiu :)	0
stiu ca asa e	0
oh	0
I forgot to say:	0
orangeFlu: meet fgs from Libera	0
fgs: meet orangeFlu from Libera, hahahhaa	0
	0
who is *not* on Libera these days	0
right	0
yeah	0
it used to be freenode	0
but oh well	0
then commerce happened	0
:)	0
yes	0
i dont have nice things to say about the new leadership of freenode	0
the alleged prince pretender of South Korea or something stepped in	0
i dont want to say vile things here	0
orangeFlu: that is because there are no nice things to say about who runs freenode now	0
I'm not on Libera but I recently joined Lunar	0
there just aren't	0
dar futu-i in gura de prosti, au distrus ceva minunat, curvele ma-sii si pastele mamelor lor de handicapati	0
aoleo	0
gasconheart: i needed that	0
that was some Romanian swear language :)	0
@en dar futu-i in gura de prosti, au distrus ceva minunat, curvele ma-sii si pastele mamelor lor de handicapati	0
But in the mouth of the stupid, they destroyed something wonderful, the murveters and the pastes of their disabled mothers  	0
murveters?	0
whores	0
ah	0
it translated wrong	0
it conveys the meaning	0
disabled mother paste, does that have gluten in it	0
"pastele" should be "the easter"	0
it is not an exact translation	0
handyc: yes!	0
orangeFlu: es war auf jedenfall offensichtlich  nichts nettes, was du da gesagt hast :-)	0
ken what do you think about it	0
disabled mother paste!!!!! that sounds sooo funny	0
handyc: You're abusive 	0
ken did you eat my mom's paste	0
handyc: Eat who 	0
in linguistics, Romanian is reputed as one of the languages with the richest slang and swear words in general	0
i can tell by my neighbours	0
they're yelling and cursing and swearing a lot of the time	0
I lived for 6 years among them, I can vouch for that!	0
fgs: ich weiss, aber eh... ich brauchte dass, ich habe nur Feindseligkeit fur ihnen	0
fgs: in Romanian?	0
orangeFlu: verstaendlich. 	0
gasconheart: yes	0
gasconheart: it's sadly the type of people that want to move to another country yet refuse to learn the language	0
of 5 people in the house, 1 speaks proper german	0
it's their youngest son	0
oh	0
i'm not a racist, they're just assholes	0
Romanians here in Spain usually learn the language remarkably well	0
independant of their country of origin	0
romanians arent bad people, but in my experience, people tend to notice bad romanians more because they are louder, while the nicer ones keep their nationality secret or quiet because of shame	0
I moved to Romania and learnt their language	0
oh Romanians are loud in general..........	0
Romanians are literally noisy :)	0
gasconheart: i didnt mean the traditional sense of that word	0
ah ok	0
more like, noticeable	0
got it	0
gasconheart, I think Sanskrit has the most swear words	0
handyc: maybe; I didn't know that	0
according to my Sanskrit teacher	0
handyc: i would very much like to dispute that	0
i could make a whole book of swear words, all different	0
he told me he compiled a list of them for a paper, but then somehow he lost the list	0
so I am not really sure	0
Gascon instead does not have a really rich slang, but interestingly many curse words are simply normalized	0
the word for "cock" in gascon means just... "dick"	0
you could really take any word and put it in a swear-like syntax and it becomes a swear	0
that too	0
I study politeness	0
oh	0
calculatorul ma-tii de prost	0
orangeFlu: acel "nu va suparati" este foarte interesant pentru straini	0
@en orangeFlu: acel "nu va suparati" este foarte interesant pentru straini	0
Orangeflu: That "will not upset" is very interesting for strangers  	0
what, why?	0
the "don't get angry at me"	0
it's jsut "excuse me"	0
well	0
yes	0
but	0
worded in an extremely polite way	0
yes	0
it is the utmost level of politeness	0
probably not	0
yes, it is, romanian has 3	0
this is the highest	0
it is interesting how that phrase got coded into the tradition	0
ah ok	0
when you refer to a single person as if they were two, as it is happening in many languages, it's level 3	0
level 2 is "dumneata", "matale"	0
oh ok	0
level 1 is just.. "tu"	0
ever came across "matale" in romania?	0
"dumneata" and "matale" are never taught to foreigners!	0
sure!	0
"ce faci mataluta?"	0
it sends shivers down my spine	0
i hate how it sounds	0
haha why? hahahahaaa	0
especially mataluta	0
haaaaaa	0
foreigners are expected not to use, ever, "matale" and variants!	0
I surprise Romanians and use those	0
so old and antiquated, used only by rural people, it almost doesnt even sound polite to me, it sounds almost.. batjocoritor	0
am inteles	0
what is the word	0
in english	0
@en batjocotitor	0
mocker  	0
@en batjocoritor	0
mocker  	0
yes!	0
mocker, nice	0
yeah, like you are mocking them	0
i dont know much romanians. the ones i got to know, yes, they are LOUD. 	0
they are!!	0
sadly, if they paid attention to our culture here, they wouldn't be	0
my wife is Romanian	0
or would give a fuck about their neighbours	0
they dont. 	0
i was also told i am loud when i went to berlin, really tried to dial it down	0
it is impossible not to speak by shouting with her	0
haha	0
gasconheart: she sounds lovely	0
my daughter is Romanian.... she is loud as fudge	0
my first wife was ROmanian, and loud as fuck	0
i love that every romanian is loud	0
makes my heart warm	0
my father-in-law is Romanian, he is not loud because he misses many teeth	0
thats not a condition	0
tzuica makes my heart warm :)	0
one of the neighbours misses all his teeth	0
that too gasconheart 	0
fgs: hahaa, it is not :)	0
and the motherfucker still is loud as fuck	0
amen to tuica	0
haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa	0
haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!	0
i actually have a question	0
tuica helps me endure the winters	0
ask away, son	0
mattf: you here bro?	0
yes	0
i need the romanian keyboard	0
to type diacritics	0
how do i do it	0
the physical Romanian keyboard?	0
no	0
oh	0
like ü ?	0
just the layour	0
ß ?	0
the layout	0
oh	0
well, yes, but romanian characters, not german	0
setxkbmap ?	0
mattf: you are familiar with the Romanian diacritics by now :)	0
orangeFlu: this is what I do:	0
orangeFlu: lass uns einen deal machen. ich spreche deutsch mit dir, und du probierst mir ein paar grundlagen rumaenisch beizubringen. 	0
aber nicht heute, i'm getting tired	0
which is a good thing this early in the evening!	0
orangeFlu: I have a Spanish keyboard, and I use the Spanish layout	0
fgs: haha, warum willst du rumanisch lernen?	0
orangeFlu: but I have mapped in Vim the Romanian, Portuguese and Gascon diacritics	0
so I use only ONE keyboard layout	0
and I only need those special characters in Vim anyway	0
orangeFlu: vielleicht habe ich ja so eine chance nochmal ein besseres verhaeltnis zu den nachbarn aufzubauen. 	0
ceva cu vecinii :)	0
orangeFlu: es ist nicht schoen wie es hier ist zwischen den nachbarn.	0
ok dann	0
i didnt really get the last one	0
fgs: I know Romanian perfectly, I can help as well	0
gasconheart: good to know, will come back for help	0
at some point this community will be around Romanian and Romania; but language will never be a condition here	0
sure, fgs! :)	0
Romanian is my real second language	0
its weird that we are always hanging out in #romanian, yet not so much romanian	0
orangeFlu: have you listened to my podcasts? how do I speak Romanian? :)	0
it is not "weird"	0
gasconheart: never got to ask you, do you like the language? or have you learned it because you needed it	0
language will never be a condition here	0
i have not listened	0
I don't like Romanian in a special way	0
give me the site again, am really curious	0
and I didn't really needed it	0
Spanish people, and foreigners, usually don't learn much Romanian even though they live there	0
yeah, they understand it anyway	0
becuase it is romance	0
most, yes	0
so I never really needed the C2 level.... (the highest)	0
the podcatst, pleaseee	0
i need them	0
so so much	0
I could have learnt no Romanian at all, or close to nothing, and still get by	0
orangeFlu: /whois me	0
then you will see a link to "The Gascony Show"	0
I do the show mostly in English, but with segments in Romanian and Spanish	0
you have a really nice voice	0
thanks, man	0
cant wait for the romanian, it is still english	0
oh, atunci, fa clic mai bine pe "alte inregistrari audio"	0
wooooooow	0
wow wow wow wow wow	0
there you will find my conception about a good IRC trivia, in Romanian	0
"wow"?	0
thats what i am on now	0
but the introduction was in english	0
yes	0
i skipped ahead	0
"eu sunt un admin in serverul meu" it would have been funny if you werent	0
hahaa yes	0
but just wow	0
wow = ?	0
if you had showed me this podcast with no context, i couldnt have told you are not romanian	0
haha nice!	0
flattering	0
it has happened to me in real life	0
depinde, unele constructii suna mai ciudat, dar nu des	0
I had to try to convince someone I am not Romanian once or twice	0
95% din cazuri suna complet natural, fara greseli de vreun fel	0
hai 99%	0
mersi, haha	0

"tapa" means 'lid' in Spanish,.... the snacks got named "lids" because they were usually covered by one	0
haha	0
in Sanskrit a tapasvin is someone who practice tapas, an ascetic	0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBMW60fSAi0	0
if you put lids on your ascetic then he will not be able to get out	0
fun fact, "tapa" means nothing in romanian	0

scorpio Nov 11, 2021 - Be careful about letting your imagination run away with your emotions. Grand scenarios you work up in your head may send your heart crashing when they end unfulfilled or crushed. There's a realistic tone to the day asking you to be serious and practical, especially when it comes to your feelings.	0

gemini Nov 11, 2021 - People may be relying on you in many ways today, so be careful that you don't let anyone down. You may feel like judges are evaluating your performance. Try not to get too carried away with this concept. What's most important is that you do your best, not necessarily that you achieve perfection.	0
.horo taurus	0
taurus Nov 11, 2021 - The annoying restlessness that you experience today is simply a reminder that it's important to start engaging in art projects or musical endeavors that make you happy. Learn from people who aren't afraid to follow their dreams. Don't be so concerned with what other people think of your work. Now it's important to do these things for yourself.	0

good night, guys	0

the warm contries are poor and developed nothing good because it is too warm to even think	0
oh	0
they should sell heat to the cold countries	0
they developed big assess and big boobs	0
tweeting this	0
that's why they call them developing countries	0
hahahaha	0
this is global warming	0
ok, i'm done, going to bed now	0
they could make a big tube and put their extra heat in it	0
mattf I am too exhausted to do the code	0
my brain is not working	0
I will sleep in a little while and wake up early to do it	0
otherwise I will make the whole thing worse	0
this is the best way	0
might be handyc	0
good night	0
mattf, I appreciate your help very much	0
I really will make those changes	0
those are important	0
I know, I agree with everything you said	0
it's not me being stubborn, it's me being exhausted	0
sometimes I can work like a machine for hours, and sometimes I am so tired I can barely move	0
from a quick look whoever will be looking will caught that and find very odd	0
i have that too	0
but mattf, here is a serious question	0
if it's so terrible to use that type of call,	0
then why does it exist	0
no	0
the problem is not that handyc	0
the problem is taht it looks like you dont know about the existence of "import"	0
oh I see	0
well I knew about it, but I didn't know the proper way to do it	0
but now I understand	0
but here is my fear	0
os.system, subprocess.Popen, etc ,are all useful to call other programs, like i do with figlet here	0
:fig import	0
                                           	0
   "                                  m    	0

   #    # # #  #" "#  #" "#   #"  "   #    	0
   #    # # #  #   #  #   #   #       #    	0
 mm#mm  # # #  ##m#"  "#m#"   #       "mm  	0
               #                           	0
               "                           	0
 	0
because the file paths for loading the files are based around the klurp directory and the engine directory,	0
I want to make sure that calling as a function does not confuse those things and break it	0
so I will have to make that change with great care	0
I think it should not take too long	0
it is like include in C	0
I can probably do these things in about an hour when I wake up tomorrow	0
but python is not pasting the entire file you include, like in C, it is bringing to the scope just whatever you import	0
if I can sleep for 7 hours and drink 2 cups of coffee I should be able to have the whole thing complete in 2 hours	0
you will end up removing a lot of code	0
so if I wake up at 7 I think I can have it ready to go by 9	0
you can do it	0
then I will write a brief document about how to use it and send it to the job place by 10 am	0
they said send it 2 says before the interview,	0
the interview is on Nov 16	0
which is a Tuesday	0
so you still have some time	0
if weekends do not count as days, then Friday is two days before Tuesday	0
Europeans often do not consider the weekends to count as days	0
i see	0
but they actually did not clarify this point 	0
so I don't really know	0
if you can't get it send on sunday	0
yeah but that's really rude in Europe	0
i see	0
and also, that means the HR person I send it to will have to send it on to the reviewers on Sunday or Monday	0
which means they will not have time to look it over and it could piss them off	0
the interview starts at 10:00 am	0
so if I send it at 10:00 am tomorrow, that should be exactly sufficient	0
go to sleep	0
yes	0
thanks again for your help	0
I will send you a new version soon and you can see how you like the improvements	0
goodnight	0
good night	0
these next elections will be like avengers endgame	0
ken: who will you vote for	0

(orangeFlu) You tried befriending a non-existent duck. That's freaking creepy.	0
fuck	0
i went to flick a switch and missed a duck	0
hi orangeFlu 	0
I am enjoying "your" duck now	0
hmmm	0
sounds creepy enough	0
hahaaha	0
mattf: i am installing arch linux on my pi	0
or at least trying to	0
see if i have space	0
found a little sd card with 2 gigs	0
Now i woke up	0
orangeFlu: nice	0
archpi	0
handyc: go to work	0
problem is, what can i do with 2 GB of space?	0
i will probably need to install again when the new microSD arrives	0
idk, some things orangeFlu 	0
it will fit arch and nginx	0
you can have your homepage	0
orangeFlu: What is the name of the bottom input buffer on emacs	0
this thing has a name	0
oh minibuffer i think	0
yeah, minibuffer	0
i am wayting for the sync now	0
the SD card is really fucking slow	0
like unimaginable	0
having limited resources is a good exercise	0
it's syncing for like 10 minutes now, i hate it	0
handyc: i agree	0
i was once making an OS for a very small board	0
like 32kb of ram small	0
256kb of flash	0
it was quite eye opening	0
ever since then, i detest bloat	0
yet i use pulseaudio	0
but i will fix that	0
that's cool	0
also, you might be interested in this	0
i did a project once on raspberry pi's	0
making a cluster with them	0
so i can use them for parallel work	0
and to cool them, guess what i did	0
like a beowulf?	0
nice	0
exactly a beowulf	0
I don't know, poured ice on them?	0
close	0
dropped them in mineral oil	0
well, not really mineral oil	0
oh cool	0
i got a few bottles of baby oil from the supermarket	0
I saw something like that in a computer magazine one time	0
yeah	0
it was close enough	0
so totally submerged?	0
yes	0
nice	0
i had a big rectangular glassware thingy	0
dropped them in and started pouring	0
like an aquarium	0
on full load, temp dropped by like 20 degrees	0
I do have a small glass aquarium	0
wow	0
I need to try this	0
something like that, but not that big, the glassware was used by my mom to hold food	0
the next step would have been to make a cap for the bowl	0
from metal	0
and cool that with fans	0
yeah	0
I have been thinking about something for a while now,	0
but i didnt have resoruces or expertise	0
in the winter I have to heat my house	0
all electrical devices are 100% efficient as heaters	0
because everything eventually turns into heat anyway	0
so why not have a heater that also performs computing functions	0
oh, i can answer that	0
i did that	0
please do	0
took an old radiator	0
from my grandma i think	0
and with some copper.. uhh, not wires	0
tubes?	0
i forget the name	0
rods?	0
yeah, let's say tubes/rods	0
right, okay	0
・ ​ ゜゜・。。・゜゜\_ø​< QUAC​K!	0
connect the heatsink to the radiator	0
.bef	0
orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 5.950 seconds! You have made friends with 13 ducks in #romanian.	0
it was actually going away	0
the heat	0
but the processor was not powerful enough to output that much heat anyway	0
yeah	0
if i had more computers..	0
but it worked, the radiator was heating	0
i wish i could circle water through it	0
but if you have a 1000W power supply running at 100%, that is equivalent to a 1000W heater	0
yes	0
so just get something like a bitcoin mining computer	0
you are right, all computers are 100% efficient as heat makers	0
something that pulls a lot of energy	0
the only real problem with this idea is that natural gas is still much cheaper than electricity	0
well, yes but actually no	0
if you heat your house with electricity only, it will be expensive	0
but otherwise it seems like a double win	0
because you use that electricity for something besides heating	0
yeah that's right	0
electricity that you would have used anyway	0
if you made the heater from a bitcoin miner, maybe you could earn enough bitcoins to offset the cost	0
(not in the case of mining bitcoins)	0
hmm	0
i'm not sure	0
you also have the cost of the machine itself, and you have a ROI to calculate	0
and those are expensive as fuck	0
i also do things like house warming with servers	0
i have two pretty old rack servers	0
that do nothing most of the time	0
but i used to use them for mining monero	0
because they have powerful CPUs, 4 in total	0
for the sake of argument, assume the machine is acquired for free	0
it kind of worked, i was kind of breaking even with heat versus electricity + monero wins	0
mine were	0
the servers were a gift from a former employer	0
I often find old power supplies and things in the trash, so that's not unreasonable	0
i see	0
plus, you have to account for the fact that even if you break even, it will only happen in the late autumn + winter time	0
thats less than half an year	0
yeah	0
but NL is often cold	0
I was thinking of using this method to heat my backyard garden shed	0
or a greenhouse	0
got to go eat dinner, I will be back in a little while	0
me too	0
and i have to start making it first...	0

i write stuff, they get converted into antimatter and heat for my house	0
well basically if you have a programming job the boss man will tell you to make something that is magical, you think about it for a while and then come up with something that is half magical, he yells at you for a while and this gives you incentive to work hard, then you create something that is the illusion of magic and sell it as a product, then you move to a different job to get yelled at by someone else, this is called career	0

open any of those	0
Ok this is how you spam a chat	0
my point is, just open any of those and see how it is done	0
yeah I understand	0
it's not that I don't understand import, mattf	0
it's that the way I wrote this thing, it became integrated into the whole system	0
so I will have to change a lot of stuff	0
it's not just the argv stuff	0
it messed up all kinds of paths	0
you dont have to never do those system calls, just not between other python files of the same project	0
yeah	0
I know what you are telling me	0
I think you don't know what I am telling you	0
most of the problems on our project are social problems	0
I have to make software that is unbreakable	0
the outside it more important than the inside	0
*is	0
these people I work with are so dumb that even telling them to open a terminal is frustrating	0
i can't give you advice's on the social part of the matter	0
the guy on our team who is the best at Python refuses to put Python in his path	0
and he only runs Windows	0
I told him about WSL but he may or may not have installed it	0
the only way I can find out what I need to know about his computer is to make special programs and convince him to run them and tell him to paste the output to me in an email	0
it's really an unusual situation	0
I have not heard from my boss since March of this year	0
I think he is suffering from dementia	0
I saw him in the hallway of the school but he ran away	0
you can run parallels, idk, the mac thing for a windows vm	0
even virtualbox works i think	0
yeah I should install a Windows VM on my machine, I had one going before	0
so many things are going wrong all the time	0
removing those os.system...py") will help on that too	0
my spacebar literally fell off my computer	0
I haven't been able to use my spacebar for 2 months	0

but you understand I am always on the move	0
i always used my laptop with a keyboard	0
I teach a class every week	0
yes but you code at home	0
I code wherever I can	0
I barely have any time for it	0
I wake up each morning to my son screaming for two hours	0
well that is not normal	0
it is normal in some ways	0
it is his mom trying to feed him breakfast	0
oh i see	0
mattf or handyc, ever installed archlinux arm on a raspberry?	0
she straps him into a highchair to make him eat	0
my brother had a similar problem	0
no orangeFlu, I have only used the default OS	0
my son is very smart	0
so he has a big ego like me	0
but out of the blue, my brother would start crying at about 18:00 everyday	0
he does not want to be strapped to a chair	0
he wants to spin in a circle	0
he is a good kid, I am proud of him	0
not really orangeFlu, just manjaro	0
which is a trivial install	0
but he is not very good at sitting down and eating a meal	0
if I go to the school for too long, my wife gets mad, and my son gets upset	0
thats a lot of complains handyc	0
there's really no way to get out of this situation except by waiting for him to grow up a little	0
well mattf, I am just telling you about my life	0
this is the reality of my situation	0
where are the nice things about your life	0
our project is basically dead now	0
that is a good thing	0
I have many nice things about my life	0
I have a loving family	0
I have friends	0
I have a lot of skills and knowledge	0
you live in a ocol place	0
my students respect me	0
yes	0
I enjoy what I do, and I like living here	0
overall I am not worried about the future	0
even if I do not get this job, I will not be homeless	0
yeah	0
I have enough money saved that I could even stop working for a year and it would not be so terrible	0
mainly I just want to keep doing something	0
if there is a gap in my career it would look bad	0
in academia it is difficult to get a permanent job	0
there are no jobs in Buddhist Studies anymore, it's a dead field	0
there are people on our project who know 5 languages and can't find a job	0
they are way worse off than I am	0
yeah this only has a few jobs in academia i guess	0
all the jobs are gone	0
i really hate to interject in this wholesome and kind of sad discussion. I need to tell if my archlinux boots properly, because everything is headless, and from what i am reading, i should be able to ssh into the pi, but i cant find the ip, and without a display i dont think i am able to diagnosticate anything	0
when someone retires, they don't replace that person, they close the department	0
plug it to a monitor orangeFlu 	0
i dont have a cable	0
i would have	0
or look your router what are the connect ips, dhcp thing	0
i used to have a mini hdmi to hdmi, but i cant fucking find it	0
mattf: i would, but i have no access	0
then you need to run a nmap lookup	0
or try to guess pinging	0
and besides that, the pi certainly is not connected	0
i ran nmap	0
that why i know there is no ip	0
then it might not have the ssh thing	0
or didn't connect to network	0
it is plugged over lan right	0
the ssh is not the problem	0
i dont think the boot went ok	0
can be	0
well it is hard to say anything	0
it is connected by cable to the router, the lights are blinking, i am not that stupid	0
plug  to a monitor	0
What happened to loudercake these days, is he still grounded?	0
he really disappeared	0

loudercake: you are not allowed to go missing for a week like that	0

as a half op you have to be here at least once per day	0
loudercake: hello	0
Hello orangeflu	0
just checking to see if he is a bot	0
loudercake is a good guy	0
he is smart	0
one day he will learn how smart he is	0
what	0
I remember in the ancient times,	0
I had to tell mattf that he was a genius because he did not know	0
yeah, i think it is a bot, not the real loudercake	0
that is stupid handyc	0
beep boop	0
see?	0
neither me or you or anyone here are geius	0
geniuses	0
ge...wut	0
mattf, you still don't know that you are a genius?	0
geniuses are too rare	0
you are so dumb, mattf	0
only lampGenius is	0
he is on #bots	0
stop being so dumb and realize that you are a genius, mattf	0
handyc lmfao ironic	0
i love irony	0
handyc: stop being so dumb and accept you are dumb	0
i agree with mattf actually	0
mattf, I can't deal with nihilists	0
orangeFlu, you are also a genius	0
you guys are all so smart but you are too dumb to notice	0
why are you doing this	0
 5 min ago:	0
there are people on our project who know 5 languages and can't find a job	0
they are way worse off than I am	0
what IS smart for you handyc	0
I can't deal with self convinced people ;)	0
you should meet a real genius, then you will call very few people geniuses	0
there aren't many	0
i met one, once	0
a number of years ago	0
what kind of genius 	0
you guys wanna play gartic phone? 	0
the kind that did integrals in 10th grade, and was in the national phase for math and physics contests	0
also he was a good in programming	0
15 years old	0
loudercake: gartic what? man... we have unno here, who needs that 	0
that guy made me lose faith in myself for a number of years	0
I work with geniuses every day	0
It's easy for me to spot a genius	0
orangeFlu: That is awesome, those guys exist. Well i started studying calculus when i was 12 yo	0
I was one of those guys who had absolutely no friends during school times	0
I always had about 1 or 2 good friends at any time	0
how advanced calculus are we talking here?	0
the first 3 years of my uni were so easy that i didn't have to study, thats when i started learning to code	0
not very many, just 1 or 2 but close friends	0
now i am starting to feel bad about myself again	0
yes, I had this study problem also	0
that's why I was a bad student	0
orangeFlu: you still have a job and i dont	0
i dont care about the fucking job	0
and i do	0
you only put value in what you dont have	0
i thought myself to be smart kind of, but i want to be more, and cant shake the feeling that if i had worked more, i could have been better now	0
you only realize that you had something after you loose it	0
when I was in high school I thought I was too dumb for university	0
i am too dumb for university, i still hadnt finished it	0
we are all smart kinds, we are computer nerds	0
i simply cant understand some thigns	0
the paradox is,	0
university is the dumbest crap, 	0
the smarter you are, the more you think about being smart,	0
being forced to learn what you dont want to	0
so the smartest people often think they are the dumbest	0
the people who think they are smart are often very dumb or average	0
i dont know, maybe i didnt put that much effort in uni after all, there were a lot of stuff i just didnt want to learn	0
thats bullshit handyc, real smart people dont care about that	0
mattf, there have been studies on it	0
look at the Dunning Krueger effect	0
dunning-krueger effect?	0
in the end what prooves if you are smart or not is what legacy you left, what have you done	0
oh, too late	0
people who are very very skilled at something often think they are very lacking	0
people who have a small amount of skill often think they are near the top	0
yes that is true	0
well, to be fair, i think it is the other way around	0
you inversed the cause-effect here	0
the more you know about something more you realize how that something can go much deeper than what you know	0
I didn't say anything about cause	0
I think the cause comes from various places	0
cause: people are good at something, effect: they think they are lacking	0
in my case, I would say, I think my parents figured out I was smarter than they were from an early point, and it embarrassed them	0
so they told me I was dumb	0

handyc you befriended a duck in 2.991 seconds! You have made friends with 75 ducks in #romanian.	0
(mattf) You tried befriending a non-existent duck. That's freaking creepy.	0
.bang bitch	0
(orangeFlu) There is no duck! What are you shooting at?	0
handyc: mine were the other way around	0
oh yeah	0
?	0
told me i was so smart all the time	0
well you are smart, it's clear	0
you already told me about your baby oil computer	0
which made me very embarassed and upset when i couldnt do or understand something	0
no idiot would think of such a thing	0
which made me be convinced of the oppsoite	0
yes, that's a common problem for geniuses	0
no, its a common problem for smarter than average people	0
I think people overestimate what it means to be a genius	0
There are more geniuses around than you may think	0
its all semantics in the end, thats true	0
but they tend to be located in specific places	0
I work in a program that is very difficult,	0
at this level of Buddhist Studies, you pretty much have to be a genius just to be in the department	0
everyone knows several languages	0
I work with this Buddhist tantra guy	0
i need to smoke so bad, i have anxieties right now	0
sorry	0
i can't	0
go and do it, I will still be here	0
this Buddhist tantra guy I work with blows everyone else out of the water	0
he publishes so many papers every year	0
I think he must be younger than I am	0
he basically does Sanskrit every waking moment of his life	0
it's incredible, I could never do it	0
but the real Sanskritists also know German and Japanese	0
and Tibetan and Chinese	0
All of the best research on Sanskrit is coming out of Japan and Germany, so you have to be able to read those languages to know what has already been done	0
and you have to know Tibetan and Chinese because all of the most famous Sanskrit works were also translated into those languages	0
I am only just getting started, my language skills are mediocre	0
but even someone like that has trouble getting a job, because there are no longer jobs for any of these things	0
well thing is	0
nobody cares about that	0
i am better now	0
I was busy	0
but i cant even make the damn pi work	0
I'm a clan chief	0
Galvao, in my office	0
who is galvao?	0
i am going to start the whole proces again, i must have did something wrong	0
can be that something went wrong with the way you flashed the sd	0
orangeFlu: what pi is yours?	0
4 B	0
i dont know, man, i followed the exact instruction on their website	0
is it 4 bit	0
666	0
damn	0
my keyboard is dead	0
64 bit	0
it is the one with 8 gb of ram right	0
i think there are two models, one with 4gb, one with 8gb	0
but both are raspberry pi 4B	0
the second revision of the 4	0
Broadcom BCM2711, Quad core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.5GHz	0
2GB, 4GB or 8GB LPDDR4-3200 SDRAM (depending on model)	0
i see	0
oh the alarm page has it specific for rpi4	0
https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv8/broadcom/raspberry-pi-4	0
Title: Raspberry Pi 4 | Arch Linux ARM	0
oh but yours is not armv7	0
well ours here is a rpi3B+ and it is aarch64	0
and this manjaro is meant for rpi4's but also works on this rpi3	0
the rhasbian that it had before was armv6 or so, 32 bits	0
even though the cpu could also work on 64 bits	0
i dont know much about pi's really, they are so expensive here, i neer had one	0
they are expensive here as well	0
we are not a first world kind of country	0
yeah i know	0
at least it is not brazil	0
but they were given to me for free for a project	0
and then they kind of forgot about them	0
so i got them	0
i have a lot of boards exactly for that reason	0
i even stole some old processors from my uni	0
they had them in a scrap pile	0
i took them for sentimental reasons	0
this makes me sound like a fucking weirdo, but i love processors	0
just as a collection?	0
yes	0
they are not usable for crap	0
some pentiums from 1992 and 95 i think	0
internet is slow as shit today	0
either that or the mirror from where i download the arch is slow	0
aria2c, spawn multiple parallel things with -x i thing	0
what is that for?	0
maybe torrent	0
aria2c is a good downloader	0
that isnt the problem	0
jsut checked, my speed is good enough	0
10 ms, 217up, 79 down	0

that will let you recover from where it stopped and can improve speed spawning multiple parallel workers, downloaders, i have to use it sometimes because i... live in a farm	0

which one	0
I am on an external keyboard now	0
wooow	0

I bought a pretty nice keyboard from aliexpress	0
you should get one of those that are very small and portable, they are not that expensive	0
It is difficult using the spacebar again	0

noooo	0
i had some good recomandations	0
I did	0
now remap caps lock to esc and open vim	0

orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 2.941 seconds! You have made friends with 15 ducks in #romanian.	0
I have been thinking about this setup for a long time	0
i want the Keychron K6, i've heard so many good things about this one, i cant wait to buy it	0
now I have 3 levels of keyboard	0
yeah I would like to get good at vim mattf 	0
yeah seriously	0
 	0
the keys are in slightly different places	0
it is ergonomic	0
I am serious too	0
this keyboard is a bit wider than my macbook	0
my next step is a ergonomic keyboard like kinesis or those split mechanical keyboards	0
it cost me 30 euros	0
no I don't like those	0
keychron k6	0
keychron k6	0
keychron k6	0
keychron k6	0
you should talk to Gil about his keyboard	0
is that ad spam	0
you are spam	0
he has one of those with the pits and stuff	0
where your hands don't move at all	0
it's weird	0
I don't like it	0
i like it	0
i dont like those	0
horrible	0
that's okay with me	0
i want to use my thumbs more	0
use what you like	0
i have a razer huntsman elite, the keys are so smooooooooooooth	0
I don't tell people how to live	0
but expensive as fuck	0
but yeah open vim handyc	0
this one is a decent full size flat keyboard with round keys and a rubber mat on top	0
okay I am opening it now	0
and exit with ZZ not with :wq	0
you are already being a pro then	0
wow	0
already a huge improvement	0
open vim, type :vimtutor	0
I really did not know about ZZ	0
i dont get it	0
it doesnt work for me	0
oh 	0
vim or nvim?	0
I don't seem to have vimtutor	0
vimtutor is a shell command hah	0
to me it is a shell command	0
orangeFlu: ZZ ?	0
it is not :ZZ	0
just ZZ	0
on normal mode	0
ooooh, capital Z	0
yes	0
got it	0
that means save and close	0
no idea why the hell ZZ means, maybe "im sleeping now, please save and close"	0
it is better to be honest	0
i created ZD, ZS as well	0
yeah that makes sense	0
okay now I have a mouse too	0
the Mac is already receding into the distance	0
handyc one of the cool things about vim is using hjkl instead of the arrow keys, but that takes a while	0
you dont need a mouse where we are going	0
I can hook this up to the big TV too and be done with the Mac screen	0
mattf, you don't know where I'm going	0
back to the future!	0
you can train me on vim, I am grateful to be your student,	0
but I also like a mouse for the things I do	0
well i know some things about vim, more than emacs i think	0
I still like a mouse for things like photo cropping	0
i dont really know any pure emacs keybinding besides C-e, C-a, C-u,.. the shell ones	0
handyc: yeah of course	0
handyc but i think you know some vim already	0
you know about the modes right?	0
handyc: you really serious about learning vim?	0
well I know that there are modes	0
yes really	0
do you know what mores exist?	0
I know that there is mode switching	0
but I am really a vim novice	0
I am not even sure what the difference is between vi and vim	0
not much	0
ok so when you open vim you are on normal mode. Makes sense right. This mode you can move the cursor arrow with the arrow keys or with hjkl	0
I am an honest man\	0
if I tell you I know something, I really know it	0
if I tell you I don't know, I don't know	0
and if I tell you I want to learn, I mean it	0
another moves that are useful: w (word) e (end of word), b (word back)	0
and you can scroll up and down with C-u and C-d	0
okay nice	0
oh this keyboard is really advanced	0
after you are on the place like or close to it you can press i to start insert mode, you can just type then and esc will always bring you back to normal mode from any mode	0
it has some weird special keys on it	0
let me show you what I bought	0
it's not incredibly fancy	0
another ways to get into insert mode. I will get you inserting on the beginning of the line just before the text	0
mattf: blondy requests your presence in Sunrise's server	0
A will do the reverse, append to the end of the current line	0

no problem	0
armv7 style	0
hahah i called their server "romania" on my booksmarks gasconheart 	0
i mean, there was a problem, but i must have done something wrong	0
interesting	0
I bought the larger one with the numpad on the side	0
the third option	0
It comes with a protective rubber overlay that I like very much	0
it gives the keys a bit more tooth	0
handyc vim can take range arguments before the actual commands	0
like dd deletes a line	0
you can type  4 dd and delete 4 lines in sequence	0
or you want to write a very long line for  testing purposes	0
did you know you could tell pacman to use multiple parallel connections when downloading packages?	0
it speeds up everything so much\	0
you hit 10, type whatever you want and when you hit esc you get it ten times	0
like this	0
10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 	0
orangeFlu: yes it is the default now even	0
it is not	0
it was commented for me	0
it is not?	0
i set it to 15	0
well i have it	0
i used a pacman wrapper before	0
that did that	0
i forgot what was called	0
doesnt matter	0
i like pacman	0
love it even	0
it is nice	0
now better	0
you are better	0
cant wait to play around with this pi	0
i wonder what i can do with it	0
run a deep web hitman scam site	0
i could	0
yeah!	0
and report the ones who buy stuff to the relevant police	0
except, wait	0
i shouldnt have said that on a public irc	0
no, now we know	0
that's awesome re: dd etc. mattf	0
I read about those things but I didn't try them	0
it's going to take me a little while to get used to this new keyboard but I guess I just need to dive in and do it	0
I have no idea what will happen to this macbook in a month	0
if they don't ask for it, I won't offer it back	0
they probably dont want it	0
i guess its old enough they would rather get a new one	0

can't do much with it	0
orangeFlu: you downloaded the data Google is willing to allow you to see that it has on you	0
of course	0
how did you do that?	0
never said anything else	0
yeah	0
search for google takeout	0
you can opt to delete it too	0
thanks	0
but it deletes everything	0
opt to say that it is deleted	0
if i were to be pedantic, i would say by the GDPR they are obligated to make it easy to see and delete the data	0
do i doubt it they delete everything?	0
sure	0
but it's worth a try	0
i have been trying for some time to degoogle myself	0
almost there	0
except for the phone	0
btw, it took them like 5-6 hours to round up all the data they supposedly have	0
mine was 2GB	0
for my brother, he ahd 4 gigs, and it took 10 minutes, mine is 14 and it took a few hours	0
oh, really?	0
the bad thing is, when you are so young, you dont realise just how much data you give away until it is too late	0
yeah	0
I don't use google products very often	0
but my phone is linked to google so that I can use google play	0
you probably figured that out much earlier, i was still very much a kid when this bulk data collection started happening	0
yeah, I lucked out, I was born on the edge of the transition	0
well I was born in 1979	0
so I was a young adult when all this stuff started happening	0
about my age?	0
I think you are 20 years younger than I am	0
yes	0
I feel lucky that I didn't come of age in the age of mobile phones	0
people don't have many photos of me	0
it had its perks, but looking back, it wasnt worth it for all the shit there is of me online	0
weird, when i was small, i wanted to be known	0
there are perks to anything	0
no i just wish to scrub it all	0
now	0
yes, who doesn't want to be famous when young	0
not really famous, more like, having a lot of friends and being appreciated for something	0
and now that I do not want fame I am starting to become known	0
how so?	0
for your work?	0
I have several published papers, I am a member of various networks of scholars, etc.	0
I am not a big bull scholar but my work is unique enough that many people in my field have heard of me	0
in the humanities a person with computer skills is considered very valuable	0
so even though my coding skills are not amazing, many people in the humanities think well of me for that	0
and yet, nobody offers you a job..	0
congratulations then	0
being famous and being offered a job are different things	0
most books published in the humanities do not make any money	0
ha ha, thank you	0
well, I do feel I have accomplished many things I wanted to do	0
I have met many of the biggest names in this field	0
and worked with them	0
i dont feel like i accomplished shit yet	0
but it is a disappointment to meet one's heroes	0
still working towards that	0
you should not be hard on yourself	0
why?	0
I was not joking when I was talking about genius earlier	0
i've found that being hard on myself is a good way to move forwards	0
People do not just come here at random	0
gasconheart knows what he is looking for	0
handyc: i know you were not, which makes me all the more confused, you have knowm me for close to 1 month	0
yes, it's good to be hard on yourself in that sense	0
orangeFlu, I am a good judge of character	0
I ask relevant questions to get the kind of information I want	0
I can tell a lot about a person very quickly	0
I know that you are incredibly intelligent	0
simply from our earlier conversation about radiators	0
gasconheart just stumbled on to me because i was looking in the #romania channel of libera to see if there was anybody there to talk to	0
it was just a radiator though	0
most people do not know what a radiator does	0
plus, i have not foreseen many things with my baby oil experiment	0
handyc: what do you mean, they are in all cars, and at least here, in our homes	0
Bun venit, hapciu, în serverul IRC al lui Gasconheart! Fii răbdător, curând o să vină cineva să vorbească cu tine. 	0
you are very similar to mattf, you are so smart that you outsmart yourself	0
what do you mean by that?	0
when I say to you that all energy goes eventually to heat, you nod and say okay	0
and I can tell from that that you are intelligent	0
because if I say it to most people they don't know what I mean	0
these are the small but telling things	0
i say ok because it all makes sense and i thought about it myself. I mean, to be fair, a very tiny amount does go to form a magnetic field around the wires, but most of it is heat	0
smart people often do not realize they are smart because they congregate around other smart people	0
yes, you see, and from comments like that I know you are a genius	0
because you felt obligated to add that qualifier	0
by that logic, all my friends are genius because they will say the same thing	0
you probably do hang out with geniuses	0
most of my friends are also geniuses	0
maybe you are trying to make me believe in myself more, maybe you are sincere	0
i havent decided	0
I am sincere, but I don't know much about you	0
I'm just telling you my impressions	0
I am a good judge of character based on my past experience with people	0
I have met many people and many smart people,	0
and I have certain skills of my own that make it easier for me to identify certain kinds of people	0
It's not about building you up so much as pointing out to you that I know something about you based on the limited conversations we've had	0
I don't think we've even know each other a month, probably much less	0
I would have to check the logs to be sure	0
it was more like a week	0
yes that is what I thought	0
there is not really an ulterior motive here,	0
I like to meet and interact with smart people,	0
I hang out here because gasconheart himself has a certain skills in bringing these kinds of people here,	0
so it is easy for me to interact with people I enjoy talking to without needing to do anything	0
excuse my typos, I am on my new keyboard	0
excuses handyc	0
hole day of excuses	0
whole	0
mattf, you think you work hard, but you have not yet learned to be lazy	0
hahaha i dont rly work hard	0
i do work on useless things	0
excuses	0
like this IRC	0
this IRC is not useless	0
mattf, do you remember when gasconheart and I pooled our money and bought you SDF membership	0
hahahaha	0
what is SDF?	0
nothing	0
it is like tilde but with bsd	0
and the are a isp and vps provider	0
sdf.org	0
https://sdf.org	0
how do enter insert mode in vi? mattf 	0
Title: SDF Public Access UNIX System - Free Shell Account and Shell Access	0
orangeFlu: i, a, I, A	0
one of them	0
something is broken here	0
oh yeah you guys bought me a metaarpa account or something, that only pays once	0
25 usd	0
because of alacritty	0
on vim?	0
vim over ssh	0
vi*	0
yeah, it transmits the wrong TERM var	0
oh god but it is only the i key	0
i ahd this problem before	0
i mean, the var is set correctly	0
oh i see, i had that too	0
but some keys are registred wrong	0
or interpreted wrong	0
12,50 usd from each. Gasconheart i think that clearly paid by now	0
handyc, the python code consultant is 30 usd, you owe me 17,5 usd	0
im kidding guys, pls dont send me money, im into working for free	0
mattf, never work for free	0
agreed	0
do stuff for money	0
mattf you owe me $962.73 for my life coaching	0
if you do a job for me, i will give you money, not even joking	0
not much money, because i am not paid that well either here	0
life coaching ? oh god	0
in US English we use a period to separate dollars and cents, not a comman	0
comma	0
oh yeah i know that	0
this piece of advice is worth $5.32	0

i stopped	0
good	0
it just responds very late	0
that is true	0
at some point we will migrate the bots to the same saver as the ircd	0
where are they now?	0
my vps	0
that explains a lot actually	0
where is that vps? what provider?	0
or we could move the ircd to my vps but then this wouldn't be gascon's irc	0
linode	0
uu, nice	0
nice choice	0
cheap choice	0
i actually want to do some back-ups there	0
they block outgoing on port 22 here	0
wondered how much would it cost	0
mattf: here... on your farm?	0
i mean, i cant ssh to something that is bound to port 22	0
here in brazil it seems	0
i lived in 2 different cities, they had this same problem	0
you sure? seems like an odd choice	0
it is 	0
i called them and they didn't know what to do	0
you need to move to a better country	0
can you login via some graphical console, i.e. via the hosters customer panel? 	0
at least on my region it happens	0
i want to	0
rebind sshd to 8080	0
oh nooo but i dont mean in linode	0
thats not the problem	0
i have done that on my linode yes	0
and i use it as a proxyjump for other servers	0
thats one of the reasons i have this vps	0
another one is those bots and some telegram bots	0
for you to move to another country, you realise you need to start working for money, no?	0
orangeFlu: exactly	0
well, then, do something, do jobs on fiverr, something	0
and come to romania	0
i started freelancing and learning meanwhile, building a portifolio until i feel prepared	0
i started on freelancer.com	0
i tried fiverr but didnt like it	0
all the internet you can have, a gigabit up and down, fiber in my home, and no censorship because they dont know how to censor	0
but now i have enough clients to keep me busy	0
i still want to do my stuff	0
i download a full 4K movie of about 40 gigs in a few minutes	0
you would love it	0
I may have to try one of those places soon	0
that is awesome	0
unless I get a permanent job	0
i have 10mbps on the city	0
;(	0
10mbps makes me sad	0
it is no way to live	0
oh when i fire had it i found amazing	0
first*	0
i should mention, that 4k movie thing is only on torrents, becuase i download from multiple people, i dont get the same speeds when downloading from one server	0
i heard in germany you can get a fine for downloading copyrighted content on torrents	0
thats such a foreign concept to me	0
yes i heard that too	0
that sucks	0
can you torrent over tor or vpn?	0
never have been bothered, i have a few terabytes of illegal movies 	0
yeah, how I met orangeFlu was a fluke!	0
or you can have a vps in romania or a nice place	0
yes	0
you can over vpn	0
but the vpn server must support it explicitly	0
for example, when i connect with proton	0
only a few have that P2P icon	0
i have a vpn server on my vps	0
idk if it can torrent	0
it works over tor too, but it is sooooo slow	0
tor is slow	0
i suspect it can	0
of course it is	0
did I mention we are available over tor now?	0
(more than 10 times already)	0
tor is slow	0
one moment my friend	0
no, but you said we are on the darknet	0
fgs: tor is privacy enhanced :)	0
chatdotju32g5swnixwnqzgpsytc4umjfdqmkv2xt52lfw4on2rccmyd.onion	0
no NetBSD today, fgs .......	0
well thats the link for this irc	0
how much did you wait to get chatdot in the name?	0
less than 1 hour	0
oh, nice	0
url = https://github.com/hephaest0s/creatorrc	0
Title: GitHub - hephaest0s/creatorrc: Create torrc files optimized for speed, security, or avoiding captcha ... [trunc]	0
try 2-3 characters more and you will hate yourself	0
no no	0
hahaha	0
use this tool to generate your torrc and use excludenodes	0
creatorrc --speetor	0
you'll notice it's considerably faster	0
i wouldn't try one more, but on v2 i think i had 8 characters	0
it selects nodes based on bandwidth?	0
different selectors	0
one of them is speed yes	0
interesting	0
can recommend	0
very interesting	0
using it on about 10 machines	0
tor will tell you you're doing it wrong and you hopefully know what you're doing	0
my usecase is hiding my crap from my is	0
+p	0
well, the weak point of tor after all is the guard, and that doesnt change either way, so you might select freely all other nodes after it	0
you can specify your guards too	0
even run your own at the price of reduced anonymity	0
tor is like ssh, on the surface looks easy to use, but on the depth, you can do _a fucking lot-	0
dont see much point in that, i would maybe leave it to the system to decide	0
well if you're doing actually sensible stuff - i agree	0
my usecase, as said, i dont want my ISP to know what i'm doing	0
like torrenting in germany	0
i didnt know you can do such things, this is interesting, thank you	0
torrenting via tor is plain fucking stupid	0
yeah	0
guaranteed leak of your real IP	0
i think so too	0
w	0
how would it leak?	0
the file transfer is 'tor masked'	0
i think mentaloutlaw made a video recently about this, or one of those guys	0
the rest is not ;-)	0
oh, shit	0
and the typical tor client wont like to be 'torify'ed	0
tor is tcp only	0
so, your only way out is using the socks5 proxy tor gives you	0
and that will leak meta info	0
b/c other requests will go out over clearnet	0
dont torrent via tor	0
torrent uses both udp and tcp right?	0
yes, it can be either	0
(for the file transfer that is)	0
for the additional stuff, i.e. requests to the tracker, that is http	0
which is also tcp	0
bingop	0
well tor is tcp only	0
-p	0
torrenting via tor - you could try via tailsOS	0
i didnt try yet so i'm not sure	0
tailsOS, if it works in there, would make sure nothing leaks. 	0
but it _should_ not work 	0
what do you mean, http is TCP	0
who lied to you	0
who lied to you?	0
they are not connected, they are different layers in the stack	0
it's like saying "http? it means you are using ethernet, not wi-fi"	0
telnet is a tcp client	0
you can telnet any http server in the world and say GET /	0
sure	0
and who says you cant do that with UDP?	0
http over UDP?	0
even https	0
search	0
duck duck go it	0
well i never seen it	0
http/3	0
hah	0
a new http protocol based on udp	0
omg :D	0
http/42	0
...we should revert to gopher and remove design elements from hypertext delivery. 	0
it uses QUIC instead of tls	0
for https	0
yes	0
gopher is cool	0
who uses that	0
<	0
its just another protocol, it is still udp	0
i mean udp http	0
fgs: idk if you're serious, but many people strongly believe that	0
udp http?	0
yes	0
it is a thing	0
i know	0
i know i know	0
i dont like this	0
you can run most tcp services, ssh too, via udp	0
but seems it is the future	0
doesn't mean you should	0
not sure why people have this misconception that a certain protocol on the application layer HAVE to use a certain protocol on the transport layer	0
different layers	0
that's the whole point	0
s/HAVE/HAS	0
not sure why people HAS this misconception that a certain protocol on the application layer HAS to use a certain protocol on the transport layer	0
fuck, it corrected twice	0
someone teach _gonzobot that this requires a slash in the end	0
otherwise it's fucking syntax error lul	0
it's not sed	0
that is, well because it is more usual to see that stack	0
at least  i dont think	0
s/a/b/ is sed syntax	0
b/ is sed syntaxt leb/ is sed syntaxst  i dont think	0
;-)	0
it is not, i made one that supported regex once	0
lol what, i broke it	0
fgs: i was trying to say i dont think it was mean to be sed syntax	0
s/mean/meant	0
fgs: i was trying to say i dont think it was meant to be sed syntax	0
it is sad	0
sad?	0
:(	0
this is sad, not sed	0

orangeFlu: i got that much. i was just in edgelord mode ;-)	0
there is no alternative sed syntax lel	0

yes, the linux cds	0
i can translate between you two	0
Dar ce sunt?	0
But what are they?  	0
sunt cd-uri cu linux, un alt sistem de operare	0
windows e numele sistemului de operare facut de microsoft	0
Printre ele sunt si Windows Xp si Windows 7.	0
Among them are Windows XP and Windows 7.  	0
linux nu e facut de cineva in mod special	0
i am not sure which linux distro he sent you Profilq0`, i recommended some to gasconheart but i don't know which one he picked	0
Nu sunt sigur că Linux Distro pe care ți-a trimis-o PROFILQ0 ", am recomandat unii la GasConheart, dar nu știu care a ales  	0
sunt sute de persoane care lucreaza la el, si e gratis in totalitate	0
cred ca ti-a trimis linux mint daca imi amintesc bine	0
sugerez sa incerci linux	0
mattf: i think he sent him linux mint at least	0
M ar interesa sa nu pierd ceea ce am pe laptop. Eu windows ul in el il am in partitia C.	0
M would be interested not to lose what I have on my laptop. Me Windows in him I have in partition C.  	0
asta va fi complicat	0
ai un stick sau hard disk extern?	0
Oh i see, well you dont have to loose it. Create a new partition where you will install linux and you can keep both systems on the same computer	0
pe care sa iti pui datele?	0
Oh, văd, bine că nu trebuie să-l pierzi. Creați o nouă partiție în care veți instala Linux și puteți păstra ambele sisteme pe același computer  	0
Mi a trimis Linux. Pai vreau sa cumpar un hard extern.	0
Me sent linux. Well I want to buy an external hard.  	0

Profilq0`: your windows doesn't boot at all anymore?	0
PROFILQ0: Ferestrele dvs. nu mai cizmează deloc?  	0
Ok, atunci ideea mea ar fi urmatoarea: bagi un CD, nu conteaza exact care, linux sau windows si incerci sa te folosesti de sistemul de operare de pe ele sa iti recuperezi datele si sa le pui pe un hard extern	0
and there are files there you want to recover?	0

I think I'm only firing up X11 for the UTF-8 support in uxterm......	0
if the tty had that, I'd stay at the tty	0
yes, it's nice to have that support	0
one thing I've done in the past is start X11 on a Pi and automatically load a terminal window fullscreen with no decoration	0
that way it looks like text mode but you get all the characters	0
oh, yes, I used to do that sometimes too	0

gasconheart: how's the pkgsrc build going, any issues? 	0
no issues	0
it is slow as hell though	0
I am not complaining :)	0
probably the machines fault isnt it	0
i remember its x86	0
the hardware is slow and old itself	0
exactly	0
I am not complaining at NetBSD	0

hey fgs 	0
I have this creazy idea	0
s/creazy/crazy	0
I have this crazy idea	0
tell me	0
what if I install pksrc in my old Linux Debian machine, so I can install the most recent version of OpenSSH there?	0
do you think that may work?	0
well you could as well just build the latest opensshd yourself	0
orangeFlu, teensy is like arduino	0
in that case, i think it's safe to say pkgsrc wont give you a bonus	0
it's a programmable microcontroller	0
having the latest version of OpenSSH in my 32-bit machines is my main goal, I would say	0
fairly sure you can just get and build the opensshd sources on linux, gasconheart 	0
oh I see fgs already answered	0
I have the teensy 2 already and it's great	0
handyc: o/	0
how are you sir	0
that's right, fgs 	0
doing great, killed a big bug recently and now running some new text alignment tests	0
after 4 years on this project I am finally getting somewhere	0
1 month left in my contract	0
gasconheart: same for netbsd too, you should be able to just build sshd there - maybe with some more options to the ./configure script	0
fgs: I found OpenSSH already installed in my NetBSD machine, and a recent enough version of it actually	0
perfect	0
I'm trying to build irssi now	0
theres definitely a binary for irssi	0
ok, but I want to get used with pkgsrc	0
unless you specifically want to build it from source, you dont need to	0
for training purposes	0
go ahead then	0
right on 	0
yeah!	0
I think pandoc should be flagged somehow to indicate that the install from pkgsrc won't work on i386	0

gasconheart you shot a duck in 96.307 seconds! You have killed 235 ducks in #romanian.	0
i'd probably try with a "grep -r PKG_FAIL_REASON *" in the /usr/pkgsrc/*/pandoc directory	0
if that gives you a file, you know next timt where to look 	0
or check pkgsrc docs lol	0
but who reads docs ;)	0
OH WAIT	0
it's not pandoc that breaks	0
it's ghc	0

country codes to language codes?	0

i dont think there's many of these examples tho	0
that doesn't make sense to me and there might be intersections	0

oh	0
ok	0
that easy	0

yeah 3 characters, they are more finely described	0

yeah I understand that	0
your bot is great	0
I am just saying that if I made such a thing from scratch, I would use ISO 639-3 codes	0
iso-3 is kind of strange ... every code seems to somewhat match the countries name	0
and then we have DEU->germany	0
which makes sense, deutschland	0
tschl	0
but every other code seems to randomly match the english name of the country in question	0

gasconheart: to my office	0
I'm testing some stuff on my Pi4	0
this is handyc	0
I put an old garbage monitor in a briefcase	0
this will be my new garbage laptop	0
I will learn vim on it and become rich and famous	0
wow, this new keyboard seems way more comfortable to use on the Pi for some reason	0
are you handyc	0
maybe just the position I'm sitting in	0
yes I am handyc	0
whois handyc	0
handyc is no one	0
he does not have a 3 letter name like me	0
ok you guys have the same ip	0
yeah	0
that's one thing I wanted to checj	0
check	0
ā	0
ṣ	0
ś	0
why everyone here has a pi	0
because we are all nerds	0
I am going to buy the new Pi Zero 2 also	0
and a Teensy 4.1	0
I want to learn more about microcontrollers	0
also, I have this ongoing obsession,	0
I want to make the smallest computer I can 	0
that is still comfortable to use	0
this is not bad	0
but the monitor will make it pretty heavy	0
One thing that has really been driving this project lately is my son,	0
ok this is certainly handyc isn't it	0
sometimes I am in a situation where I can't use the regular laptop	0
of course	0
can't you tell from the hash?	0
yes	0
still what if you were hacked	0
mattf did you see the thing about the FBI?	0
or what if it was simply someone else on your computer in your home	0
the FBI email system got hacked	0
apple stuff is all backdoored	0
That's true, it could be anyone on my home network	0
nice disguise, _b_ 	0
also, I wonder what the hash shows when I connect from the university	0
Grand Master B	0
same ip, same hash	0
maybe there is a random cloaking	0
yeah they should have the same IP, right?	0
or maybe schools have a set of IPs	0
this Pi is actually really comfortable to type on, it's so quiet	0
dosbox works great on NetBSD	0
as master oper i can still see all actual ips 	0
that's good, mattf, it's a good experiment for the room	0
we should do this type of testing often	0
let me come as penisman	0
penisman, are you coming?	0
yes	0
penisman came	0
i came in this room	0
he came all over the room	0
I just came to see if the whois command only leaks stuff to the oper	0
and yes	0
penisman, are you leaking?	0

i blacklisted penis on this room	0
okay\	0

oh can't even join	0
of course not	0
penis cannot join this room	0
the penis cannot enter here	0
that's what she said	0

this computer is inside a briefcase I found in the trash	0
I looked up the briefcase online	0
you are a different type of ricer 	0
it costs about 30 euros	0
you rice with cardboard	0
it looked okay, kind of cheap	0
I tore it apart to see what a low end briefcase was made of	0
it's just fiberboard with some clothlike material on top	0
really cheap	0
like some kind of compressed pulp board stuff	0
it's truly trash	0
but it taught me more about how to make a briefcase	0
so now I will try to make one in the same style from wood	0
the big problem is weight, though	0
I don't think I can ever really get around that	0
I want it to be durable and contain actual computer parts	0
like a portable full size computer	0
what is a ricer, mattf?	0
where is my android sdk	0
.u ricer	0
(_b_) [1/10] (Ricer: from the latin word [Ricarius] meaning to suck at everything you attempt) A person who makes unecessary modifications to their most often import car (hence the term "rice") to make it (mostly... - http://ricer.urbanup.com/559902	0
ha okay	0
Ricing comes from the car terminology "ricing" or "RICEing". In the car world, RICE stands for Race Inspired Cosmetic Enhancement. When you put a scoop on your car (that doesn't lead to a cold air intake) or a big spoiler (which won't make a difference), you're ricing. The idea is to increase its perceived performance through cosmetics.	0
https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/	0
no but I'm an anti-ricer	0
I'm not going for increased performance	0
and I'm not making unnecessary changes	0
cosmetic	0
oh.... some minutes of good old fashioned 80s pacman....	0
pacman is modal, just like Vi	0
this is nothing about cosmetics, it's entirely about practicality	0
isn't there some VI pacman	0

you eat the pill and you can catch the ghosts; it is like pressing Esc and issue commands	0
but neovim is the next frontier	0
well I am going to learn them both	0
neovim is pretty much just newer vim which is just newer vi	0
over this next month I will try and transition away from the MacBook	0
yeah, they are all basically the same thing	0

handyz is already getting really smart	0
I read on Hacker News that this guy was teaching his 3 year old son how to use the command line	0
I need to be prepared for handyz getting smart quickly	0
He can already follow simple instructions	0
When I feed the cats in the morning I give him the empty food wrapper and tell him to put it in the garbage can and he does it	0
There is an overfitting problem, though	0

sardines I can eat	0
I still have dreams about those sardines	0
sardines and other fish, yes	0
We want to go back just to eat the sardines	0
I can mail you some	0
I even marked the café we ate at on Google Earth	0
mail them, ha	0
the whole point is getting them fresh	0
I can buy canned sardines here, but it's like an entirely different food	0
that's right	0
They have something called tapas in the Netherland	0
Netherlands	0
I thought I knew what tapas was	0
they do?	0
then I tried the real tapas	0
yes, a cheap imitation of Spanish tapas	0
from the times of the Spanish Netherlands, perhaps	0
basically just snack food for parties	0
a bastardization then	0
yeah, that's right, probably a remnant of that	0
well... that *is* tapas in Spain.....	0
no but I mean the quality	0
just like Americans say they have beer	0
but Budweiser is not Affligem	0
but the quality varies a lot also in Spain itself	0
yes I'm sure	0
you may have had tapas for tourists, almost sure	0
but we found this one café by chance	0
not entirely by chance, we looked on the Internet for the best tapas places	0

new guy?	0
Because Chr doesn't occur in Chinese	0
no	0
orangeFlu: I'm handyc on a Pi	0
that makes me more confused	0
but ok	0
Chinese people can't say the name Chris because they do not have this sound combination	0
but this is nothing official or is it	0
So they gave me a Chinese name Rui Si, which sounds close to Chris to them	0
no it's not some legal name, it's just what people call me in China	0
The Han is just from my last name	0
you or they  just decided to call you like this	0

In China the family name goes first	0
would have sounded closer	0

mattf you shot a duck in 3.996 seconds! You have killed 261 ducks in #romanian.	0
.bef	0
(orangeFlu) You tried befriending a non-existent duck. That's freaking creepy.	0
i was drinking water, and i chocked	0
and still managed to not befriend it	0
hanb watch Chinese opera, no talking	0
ok	0
i am watching community	0
best sitcom ever	0
Well, my mother in law died last year	0
She was okay	0
handyc did you see that last open movie	0
She started getting pretty weird the last time we saw her	0
last open movie?	0
what does that mean?	0
dont ask him	0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cMxraX_5RE&vl=en	0
its a ponzi scheme	0
fuck	0
oh cool	0
blender movies! all assets used on its production are free to download	0
yeah that's awesome	0
very inspirational	0
they fucking killed a snail	0
in the first few seconds	0
well ok is not free but cheap	0
idk why they call open movie then	0
well still impressive how blender envolved now	0
it is the most mature and cool open source softare	0
shirley, you love jesus, and i think we could all use some old fashioned religion right now	0
when i say greendale, you say sucks. GREENDALE	0
everything is so peppery	0
orangeFlu: what are you talking about man	0
the ringleaders of the riot	0
alright	0
my brain gets weird after close to 30 hours no sleep	0
and the edges of things are starting to get dancy	0
ive been there	0
snails taste good	0
have you been awake for 30 hours?	0
i think 40 was my record	0
no, but i've never eaten one	0
that's bad for your brain	0
yeah	0
I've eaten snails a bunch of times	0
French people and Chinese people eat them	0
snails are bad for your brain? why are you eating them then?	0
Staying awake for 30 hours is bad for your brain	0
True, the french are not known for their mental sanity	0
Snails are relatively safe to eat if you cook them properly	0
snails are bad for the rbain	0
dont eat brains	0
Eating them raw from your garden can be dangerous	0
the weekend is when i have the time to do stuff for myself	0
and at this point in time	0
i feel like i am not progressing	0
i need more time	0
to work on my game	0
connection today is so grat	0
great	0
imgur.com took 2 minutes to open	0
orangeFlu: use this on your game: https://imgur.com/a/ipZXf95 : yes	0
how could i possibly use this	0
maybe as a wormhole	0
is it animating?	0
the video wont play for me	0
but i need a smaller transparent version	0
yes	0
i did it	0
its a looping gif	0
nice!	0
it is full procedural geometry nodes	0
i have a wormwhole thingie	0
if you could make it transparent, it would be very nice	0
somwhere	0
and smaller resolution	0
oh you mean alpha channel, transparent background	0
sure	0
it needs to load fast	0
yes	0
give me a min	0
well and more 10 min to upload	0
maybe something like 100x100?	0
should be easier to render and uplaod	0
upload*	0
you can always imagemagick it later	0
wait what	0
HAHAHAAAAA	0
hello how2use_my_computer_man 	0
I was helping the kid with her homework	0
you changed my identity	0
welcome to our irc	0
come on man	0
yes was learning that	0
mattf: focus	0
you can talk when it is uploading	0
btw is your game 2D?	0
yes	0
ah ok	0
because this is a 3D model of course	0
but then that doesn't matter	0
it will look maybe out of place	0
but if you make more assets, it will look fine	0
and i can pay you for them	0
you make them in blender?	0
yeah	0
i thought so	0
im a blender fan	0
I started making a game back in 2005 or so	0
i did the donut tutorial like 6 years ago but never did anything real with blender	0
now i need to see where i was with the game, because i've mostly forgotten what i did in the code by now	0
and it is rust after all	0
rust code	0
handyc: what game?	0
did you finish it?	0
i bet is some hexagonal grid thing	0
catan?	0
no, some sort of world simulation thing you will still hear him talk about every week	0
i am making a small space simulation game	0
not really simulation	0
yet	0
It was this game where all the monsters have a gene	0
genetical algorithms	0
and as you make choices in the game, the genes of the monsters change based on your choices	0
yeah	0
cool	0
sounds actually fun	0
I am still thinking of a good way to implement it	0
the basic idea is that you have a hexagonal map	0
and a radius around your character is drawn	0
my game is supposed to be something like a space simulator, with procedurally generated planets and colonies, and a simulated economy	0
but beyond that the game has not yet decided what exists	0
where every colony imports/exports, has deficits	0
so you take a step in a certain direction and that choice influences how the world is drawn next	0
so procedurally generated	0
yeah	0
but based on the choices you make	0
i see	0
so that the game would evolve to fit the player	0
i dont think mine will fucntion this way, would rather go with the seed method and a noise generator to map out the colonies and their attributes	0
i have no idea where to even start	0
for now, i am just trying to make the damn spaceship rotate and move in that direction	0
i got the rotation part, but nothing else besides that	0
i need to think	0
orangeFlu 	0
have you heard the expression,	0
perfect is the enemy of good	0

mattf you shot a duck in 3.759 seconds! You have killed 262 ducks in #romanian.	0
weechat is great	0
i dont understand irssi users	0
dont be so negative	0
i like irssi	0
handyc: i have not heard that	0
it doesnt need to be perfect	0
it just needs to work at least	0
and at the moment, i forgot a lot about how it all works	0
so i am angry	0
the code is of course poorly commented	0
by me	0
thinking that i will not forget	0
orangeFlu: https://imgur.com/a/ipZXf95	0
it is uploading	0
bellow there are 2 gifs	0
idk if this uploaded	0
oh ok it is giving it a white background.. .weird	0
the second one is transparent, right?	0
both should be but imgur is doing something to change them i guess	0
whats a good thing to send files	0
wetransfer?	0
whatever you want	0
as long as there is no compression	0
or at least, lossy	0
wetransfer was good, i think	0

oh, sure, this works	0
im going to pick one of those things that has an api and create a a script	0
later	0
it says the bin is empty	0
upload	0
reload	0
done	0
thankss	0
cool	0
does that work  haha	0
you compressed it to tar	0
and the site compressed it once more	0
when i downloaded	0
huh?	0
just untar it	0
obviously	0
just saying	0
it's weird that its done two levels of tar	0
might have been me 	0
one is you	0
another one is the site	0
ah because you choose to download all maybe	0
or it is something they had for this	0
https://filebin.net/api useful	0
Title: Filebin | API documentation	0
just realized i dont have any program whatsoever for opening these	0
fuck	0
oh, cool	0
they are working fine	0
thanks	0
yeah that's my point, orangeFlu 	0
it doesn't need to be perfect	0
it doesn't even need to be anything like your idea	0
just make a skeleton project	0
then add to it as you have time	0
one thing I found in poking around trying to make my game over the past 15 years,	0
my ideas about what I wanted to do also changed 	0
I changed the language several times	0
I started it in C	0
then I made a Flash game	0
then when Flash started dying I rewrote stuff in Javascript	0
then I got busy with school and my job	0
but it wasn't for nothing	0
now mattf is telling me to learn Godot, and I think mattf really has his finger on the pulse of what is good for things like this	0
so I am going to learn Godot and I think soon I can start making real apps	0
but i mean, i cant even make the damn ship rotate and move in the direction i rotated it, and it's os frustrating because i dont get quaternions and how to use them, which should be a pretty easy concept	0
what is godot	0
never heard of it	0
native cross platform apps kind of thing?	0

oh, i see	0
i use bevvy	0
it's actually really cool	0
it takes a novel approach to making games	0
which i really really like	0
it's called the ECS system	0
Entity, Component, System	0
it's much easier to keep everything organised, both as code and conceptually, based on purpose	0
back	0
orangeFlu is trying to learn rust	0
handyc ^	0
we will eventually use godot because it is what normies use	0
mattf, what is a normie	0
but really, like blender, it is an open source project with outstanding potential. it is actually pretty based on blender	0
just means popular handyc	0
is this not a term used for someone who is not autistic	0
it is an autistic term	0
mattf, neither of us is autistic	0
i still like the autistic vocabulary	0
mattf you are a goober	0
yeah	0
this discussion is foreign to me	0
Let us all learn Rust	0
nah	0
it's actually probbaly the best language i have learned besides lisp	0
it is awesome	0
mattf, I thought you were pro Rust	0
no i started learning it	0
i read the rust book	0
if i had to rank them, common lisp, rust, cc#	0
did some of the examples	0
I am beginning to plan to start learning it	0
i watched some rust videos	0
mattf: if i send you a video, how long will it take you to download it	0
say 1 minutes, 1080p	0
orangeFlu: youtube works fine now downloading a file idk	0
how many mbs?	0
not sure, brb	0
http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/unix-koans/gui-programmer.html	0
Title: Master Foo Discourses on the Graphical User Interface	0
but seriously handyc, we wont create games for mobile using rust... not as of today, there aren't even mature GUI libs for rust yet	0
now it might be good alternative for your GA thing	0
also for creating python libs	0
i have this thing on my list	0

you are closer to the bot	0
it registered faster	0
handyc: download the video from the link	0
i am also going to sleep	0
becuase i cant stand being awake anymore	0
thanks orangeFlu 	0
downloaded	0
what for?	0
hah	0
it failed	0
on 99%	0
...	0
what a life	0
handyc: what was the thanks for?	0
thanks for sharing your video with me	0
I just watched it	0
now it is 20 kb /sec	0
your game looks cool	0
it gave me a new idea for a game	0
nah, it looks like shit	0
ill have to use aria2c	0
How about a game where you have to make this kind of game in the game	0
it used to work to shoot the enemy ship and another one spawned, but i removed that code	0
like in your video	0
you could have a code editor in the game	0
i also thought about that	0
and you have to edit the code to make the ship do something	0
i had that exact idea	0
to the dot	0
that would be really fun	0
like 1 month ago	0
totally forgot about it	0
thanks	0
it's back in my plans now	0
i need to write it down somewhere	0
oh, i remember now	0
do you have this in a public repo	0
my idea was to start as yourself	0
do a little something something	0
like make money and stuff	0
and at some point buy another ship	0
yes	0
and that ship could have a scripting engine	0
and you could make it do your bidding	0
sell stuff, travel, whatever	0
and you could coordinate a whole lot of them	0
if you have the skills	0
but i wanted it to be like an optional part of the game, like you could play without it, but it's harder	0
and it would be easier to just learn some programming and make it do stuff	0
I played some game like that	0
really?	0
where you had to debug code to remove traps	0
haha	0
nice	0
yeah, I can't remember what it was called	0
i played a game recently	0
didnt finish it	0
it was like a programming tutorial for javascript	0
twitchbot	0
i watched now	0
but it was cool as fuck	0
Turing Complete	0
It takes you through building your own processor	0
space game! awesome	0
starting with basic logic gates	0
the final levels, you make some small games in assembly for the computer you created	0
really cool stuff	0
that sounds great	0
i think i got to the part where i had like 7-8 registers and an ALU	0
nice	0
I took a course like that one time	0
it's on steam, pretty cheap if i remember correctly	0
we had to design a CPU on paper	0
me too	0
good times	0
I still have the book for the course at my mom's house	0

I haven't ever looked at Go	0
I don't even know what it looks like	0
seems go is	0
i heard go is bloated	0
it doesn't have ;	0
yes	0
true loudercake 	0
it has a runtime	0
it has a garbage colector	0
i find rust to be a way more wise langauge	0
go tries to be easy like python 	0
both are compiled languages still of course	0
isnt rust ALSO bloated and dependency ridden	0
and none are OOP handyc	0
both have weird OOP features actually, not like java, but hacks 	0
on go you can create a struct and later assign a function to it, outside of that struct. it is kinda the same on rust but it is a trait system	0
the thing is rust tries to solve problem during compile time, so no runtime, the language syntax itself is made to work in order to avoid the classical memory management problems 	0
and go.... solves that with a runtime	0
i heard go is good for multithreading	0
and yes, seems go is more popular than rust	0
go is easier	0
I'm leaning toward Rust, it seems to fit my personality better	0
i prefer it too	0
i want to eventually learn both	0
yes of course	0
loudercake: no, rust's fame comes from the fact it is so darn fast	0
oh i see	0
well i dont really know nothing about programming	0
i am genius	0
according to handyc yes	0
according to handyc everyone he talks to is a genius 	0
everyone that poops is a genius	0
yeah	0
einstein better watch out im gonna poop in his grave	0
no mattf	0
many people I talk to are not geniuses	0
poop = 200 IQ	0
ok handyc what IS a genius to you?	0
What are you really trying to ask me?	0
what	0
I said, "What are you really trying to ask me?"	0
maybe he is asking what he is asking	0
What's the motivation behind the question?	0
did you say something mattf i cant hear you	0
handyc because i want to know your reasonings	0
what is a genius to you	0
Do you think I just tell everyone that they are a genius to make them believe in themselves or something?	0
I just happen to encounter a lot of really smart people, and I am good at picking them out	0
just tell me	0
what is a genius to you?	0
What do you mean, to me?	0
A genius is someone with an IQ over 140	0
well breaking news	0
i do not	0
me neither	0
what do you call me genius	0
why	0
why do you call us genius	0
You don't want me to call you that?	0
no dude	0
please call me moron	0
Okay	0
Hi Moron	0
hi	0
WHAT IS A GENIUS TO YOU	0
I told you	0
why do you say im a genius then	0
Oh, maybe you aren't	0
I don't meet many 14 year olds who install Arch	0
that is true	0
that is really awesome loudercake 	0
i know a 12 years old that installed arch	0
Maybe it's just the new fad among kids	0
he taught me his ways	0
Okay, maybe I made a mistake, you could be some average guy	0
i AM some average guy	0
he is an average guy	0
Okay	0
but he knows about linux	0
Yeah, you are probably right	0
We should demote him 	0
average guy with some +'s	0
ok	0
We don't need our half ops to be average	0
i tried to help you	0
...	0
eat a dick handyc	0
I don't want to eat a dick	0
Arch should be banned to the eternal byte bucket in the sky	0
there 	0
controversy	0
hahaha	0
mattf is still a genius, though	0
handyc more like hand on dick	0
because youre a gay	0
theheck	0
uh?	0
I'll let my wife know, she will probably be very surprised	0
god i feel dirty typing that	0
the internet gods  are posessing me	0
So why did you say it?	0
loudercake: chill out boy	0
handyc why are you always so phylosphical	0
Are you mad at me or mad at yourself?	0
first of all, handyc didn't edit the actual chanserv that will always make you hop	0
just have some fun man	0
You seem to make many assumptions about me, loudercake 	0
It's okay to be smart and also have fun	0
These things are not mutually exclusive	0
you dont seem to be having fun	0
Oh	0
You don't seem to be having fun, to me	0
well i am 	0
You seem like you are filled with self loathing	0
oh why do you say that	0
I just call it like I see it	0
welp	0
i'll try to be more fun	0

it can lead to problems like dementia later in life	0
did you know that smoking greatly lessens your chances of developing dementia and alzheimer?	0
it's clinically proven	0
nobody that smokes will reach the age where those mental problems manifest	0
No, I was not aware of that	0
but come on, it's funny	0
made me laugh	0
oh	0
sorry, I did not read the rest of it	0
...	0
yes, it's funny	0
I am not able to sit in front of the computer and read the conversation carefully	0
apropo if that, i kinda need to smoke real fast	0
I am moving back and forth between my office and the dining room	0
handyc: why not	0
why	0
because of my son	0
ok	0
he is crying?	0
not right now, no	0
he is a pretty easygoing kid	0
he mostly only cries when his mom is trying to make him eat something when he doesn't want to eat	0
he is a good eater, but he likes to do it on his own terms	0
he does not like to sit in a chair while he eats	0
but she does not like him to run around the room	0
I'll check that IRC, handyc, thanks	0
good *morning*, orangeFlu, how are you	0
・゜゜・。。・ ​ ゜゜\_ø<​ QU​ACK!	0
I am on the Pi4 in the living room	0
.time romania	0
(handyc) 13:39:43+0200 Europe/Bucharest - Sibiu - Romania	0
it's not morning for him	0
gasconheart: i feel like shit, i think i will attempt suicide then next time my code wont compile	0
and you?	0
why do you feel like shit?	0
please don't attempt suicide	0
orangeFlu: are you also on snoonet?	0
suicide is not to joke about	0
cases of suicide abound in my family, I am very, very sensitive to it	0
I agree, it's not something to take lightly	0
time for a walk, back later	0
we always joke about it with my friends in situations where a minor incovenience happens, we say stuff like that	0
dont take it personal, dont take it seriously	0
i am not attempting suicide	0
i am going to visit my dad, maybe we will talk when i get there	0
i only get to see him once a week	0
hi	0
people	0
election day here today, so tomorrow it will be chaos	0
hi elp	0
handy mate!	0
nice to see you	0
handyc: got a lazy way to log in, so I may sign in more often 	0
if only to make gasconheart to stop emailing me to sign in when some interesting weirdo joins up	0
What software do you use for IRC?	0
I automate all that stuff	0
I use Textual for macOS, I autoconnect with password etc. as soon as I open the program	0
You can also do that with weechat, irssi, any of the major clients	0
I just found a nice monitor in the trash	0
works great	0
oh I used to use emacs, but I don't need a full editor right now. So im on auto-login irssi, which is lame but practical	0
handyc: I'm always looking for interesting trash, but never, ever found anything useful.	0
oh, I get great finds all the time	0
Years ago, I went on a date with a really cute girl... really good looking and I was pretty fit, so my hopes were high. We were walking and flirting and she saw a wooden chair on the trash and said "oh I'm crafty I could fix that"	0
so... me being an idiot picked up the chair, thinking: this chair is getting me laid. Anyways, carried the chair for like 2 hours, was next to me when we were having a drink. People were making out all over so I thought "I'm gonna get some later"	0
I get the girl to her place and I put the chair and like put myself in a position to make out and she grabs the chair and says: THANKS BYE!	0
ha	0
I have a furniture love story	0
my last name is handy	0
when I met my wife for the first time, we had both been hired to teach at a small liberal arts college in Texas	0
she had just moved from across the US and needed furniture	0
so this other professor said to her, in front of me, hey, this guy's name is handy, you guys should to to IKEA and he can probably help you build your furniture	0
so we did that	0
she moved in with me 2 weeks later	0
we got married 6 months after that	0
that was in January 2010	0
handyc: your story is 100% more succesful than mine! lol thats true furniture love	0
lol	0
wooden chairs are good	0
professor there was very keen tho	0
I have certain stuff I look for	0
yeah he was a philosophy professor	0
and that professor's name,	0
Rod Stewart	0
no joke	0
jajajajaja	0
I told him thanks for setting us up, I'm not really a big fan of your music though	0
JAAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJ	0
that was a pretty weird place to live	0
apparently we caused quite a scandal in the school	0
people did not like us being an interracial couple	0
weird	0
oh really? howcome?	0
because I am white and she is Chinese	0
also living in sin	0
because she moved in with me before we got married	0
it was a small Christian liberal arts college	0
oh I see	0
people who have nothing better to do but get in everybody's business	0
Christians in the US are strange people	0
I was about to say that but about MOST US people	0
of course no one had the balls to say anything to our face about it	0
there are some exceptions	0
yeah, most Americans are weird, but especially conservative Christians	0
I am glad we left the US	0
we will go back in summer 2022 to visit my mom	0
but I don't ever want to live there again	0
Europe is so much more civilized	0
we are actively working on changing that tho	0
give us another decade	0
I have an interracial love story that I'm most proud of!	0
dated a black lady from mississippi... she is fat now and has 3 kids but we still write from bdays and such	0
lol	0
for our	0
I dated a black girl one time	0
that's nice that you still keep in touch	0
this girl was more into me than I was into her	0
oh I was smitten, but it was during her college exchange and when it was over she went back, and since I've always been broke I didn't go visiting. She did great tho, her husband is a really funny (and huge) guy	0
ha ha, large people	0
my wife and I are hobbits	0
I'm 1,83, thats like 6 sharp. The lady was when she was 22 (when we met) 1,90 (that was awesome) but this guy is 2,10. AND WIDE... funny enough is a school teacher... rather intimidating but with a really fun personality 	0
I wish I was 22 again	0
I am about 5'4" = 162,56 cm	0
My wife is 5 feet = 152,4 cm	0
2,10 is a giant	0
he could probably swallow me whole	0
hello everyone	0
elp: thanks for coming, my man	0
handyc: hi	0
hi gasconheart 	0
loudercake: are you there, son? wake up!!!!	0
how's it going?	0
going good	0
we just came back from the zoo	0
I just found a nice monitor in the trash	0
oooooh I envy you so much.............	0
this is God's gift to me for my birthday	0
you hobo :)	0
it's a really nice one	0
nice!!	0
a Dell monitor, I think 15"	0
very sharp, works perfectly	0
it has one of those older DVI connectors	0
I do envy you......	0
but fortunately I already had an adapter	0
gasconheart, anyone can be a trash digger	0
I kind of am too	0
I told my wife that God must have overheard how I want to get a new Raspberry Pi Zero 2 and he decided to give me this monitor for it	0
it's been a while since God last presented me a nice gift though	0
haha good!! :)	0
One time my wife and I were walking around somewhere in Texas and we got lost	0
and she had this GPS system she brought with her from the car somehow, but we were on foot	0
and the battery died	0
and we had no idea where we were	0
and I said, "Don't worry, God's got my back on this"	0
time to ask a real human	0
and then suddenly I spotted something in the grass	0
no, there were no people around	0
but I saw this object in the grass	0
and it was another GPS!	0
a dog turd	0
oh man	0
and it had a low battery as well,	0
but just enough juice to get us back to where we were going	0
it was surreal	0
and I said, "See, I told you God loves me"	0
flabbergasting, man	0
yeah, it was really weird	0
the lord works in mysterious ways	0
'THE' Lord?	0
I wonder how a polytheistic person would word that	0
he can be singular or multiple, his call	0
true that	0
I don't tell the lord how to lives their lives	0
his choice	0
or her	0
her choice	0
ha ha	0
their choice	0
our choice	0
ooooooh	0
not your choice	0
I'm pretty positive you are *not* God	0
why not?	0
intuition	0
hahaha	0
maybe we are all God and we just forgot	0
that's what many Hindus believe	0
"What if God was one of us?"	0
it was a song	0
Yeah	0
Joan Osborne	0
from 1993 I think	0
yes!	0
just a slob like one of us	0
"just trying to make his way home"	0
haha yes	0
hey	0
Where is God's home, though	0
I hope fgs is not listening right now	0
hahaha	0
but	0
why?	0
I may abandon 32-bit altogether	0
ha	0
okay	0
smart move, dude	0
I will keep fidling with this NetBSD, 32-bit machine for a while	0
It can't hurt	0
You will have to abandon it eventually anyway	0
yes	0
I just need a working computer with both the latest OpenSSH *and* minimodem	0
im here	0
loudercake: my man, how are you, young man	0
i gotta go soon	0
im goos	0
good	0
with this NetBSD machine... there is no luck with minimodem	0
oh	0
we can talk later, young man	0
it is not that I "like" 32-bit	0
I like these particular old machines I own, that happen to be 32-bit	0
I think I will install the latest Debian for 32-bit in these machines after all; debian will discontinue support for 32 bits in 2024	0
so I will give myself three years to get rid of these PCs	0
then I will buy an old 64-bit computer	0
it has to be old	0
there is no rush	0
why does it have to be old?	0
I like old hardware	0
I am not really someone who is attached to old hardware	0
I will use anything that is usable for me	0
if I could have ssh from a Spectrum Sinclair, I would be using one	0
but if I could find new hardware in the trash I would prefer that	0
hahaha	0
there is some magic in getting old and broken hardware working again	0
I have gotten pretty good at fixing things	0
When I saw this monitor today, I immediately grabbed it	0
My wife said, "What if it doesn't work?"	0
my old hardware is working fine, that makes this whole thing more painful	0
never needed a repair	0
But it can always be useful for something, even a case	0
a case, yes, why not	0
One time I found a broken screen that needed a new capacitor	0
I located the bad one and replaced it, it was not difficult	0
I once found a broken DeLorean that needed a new flux capacitor	0
that was the biggest repair I've ever had to do on a screen	0
yeah, I remember we talked about this tomorrow	0
haha	0
yes	0
I see	0
ok, this may be my route then: abandon 32-bit in a span of three years	0
it will be sad	0
when is the next date problem, 2038?	0
oh man	0
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem	0
Title: Year 2038 problem - Wikipedia	0
what will happen in 2038??	0
are you serious??	0
32 bit year overflow	0
yes	0
so you would have to abandon 32 bit anyway	0
I didn't know anything about it at all	0
let me read that	0
"relates to representing time in many digital systems as the number of seconds passed since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970 and storing it as a signed 32-bit integer"	0
I hope elinks will open it	0
oh, actually:	0
"Starting with NetBSD version 6.0 (released in October 2012), the NetBSD operating system uses a 64-bit time_t for both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. Applications that were compiled for an older NetBSD release with 32-bit time_t are supported via a binary compatibility layer, but such older applications will still suffer from the Year 2038 problem.[14]"	0
wait, there was a date problem before 2038, let me see if i can find it back	0
I guess it would still not affect 32-bit systems using NetBSD	0
I am reading about it	0
fgs: hi!	0
fgs: I think I will take my ride with NetBSD just for my pleasure now	0
gasconheart: i wish you good fun :)	0
ah yes, 2036, ntp will have issues	0
thanks ;)	0
I will still be asking you for support, hehehe	0
sure :)	0
learning some NetBSD cannot hurt!	0
testing out Pi4 again, now connected to today's new garbage monitor	0
looks great	0
https://github.com/gmag11/NtpClient/issues/70 regarding ntp and 2036	0
Title: NTP sync returns random day and time for the year 2036 · Issue #70 · gmag11/NtpClient · GitHub	0
wow, now I need to buy some new monitor cables	0
this is super sharp	0
thanks God	0
oh........ I so envy you	0
let me tell you the model number	0
fgs: I have also picked usable hardware from the trash a few times!	0
gasconheart: roadside edition hardware is usually the best	0
it's free and it's awesome :)	0
yes!!! :)	0
Dell 1707FPt	0
oh I guess it is 17"	0
wow	0
wow	0
grrrrr! :)	0
I'm waiving my fist in the air now	0
You should celebrate the triumphs of your friends	0
that's true	0
I'm glad for you	0
thank you	0
I understand the envy, though	0
you're welcome	0
hehe yes	0
but I would help you find trash in your town	0
envy and jealousy don't lead to anything good	0
helping other people always results in benefits to oneself	0
true	0
the really nice thing is,	0
the more you do this kind of trash picking,	0
the better you get at it	0
I can spot this kind of stuff a mile away	0
I don't even need to see the individual item anymore,	0
experienced hobo	0
I can tell just from the shape of a pile of trash whether or not it's likely to have good treasures in it	0
this one was just sitting by itself on the side of a road,	0
it looks like it came from some business	0
it was in one of the industrial districts	0
.... roadside edition hardware :)	0
looks like it was used as a cash register or something	0
it has some kind of coded sticker on the top	0
oh, cash register probably then	0
yeah, they probably upgraded their POS terminals to use HDMI or something	0
oh man.... all I need is having a recent version of OpenSSH and minimodem working in the same computer....	0
probably	0
btw - any response yet from mr minimodem?	0
if I manage to install minimodem on NetBSD, I will keep that 32-bit machine......	0
no, fgs	0
the coder of minimodem did not reply yet	0
well then lets wait	0
I have the tape recorder next to my computer	0
the one that runs NetBSD now	0
you are trying to interview the creator of minimodem?	0
even though I rarely use the tapes, I observe the etiquette nonetheless... now it seems a parody, since I can't input that PC with the tapes	0
I emailed the creator of minimodem asking him for hints to install it on NetBSD	0
oh I see	0
can you compile from source?	0
I tried	0
it fails	0
do you understand the error?	0
not really	0
I can't even remember what it was	0
I think something related to ALSA and other dependencies and things, that NetBSD does not support natively	0
I can try installing NetBSD on this Pi4	0
it's probably about time to wipe everything anyway and start fresh	0
and I've been meaning to try NetBSD	0
then I can run a system very similar to yours and duplicate any errors you are getting	0
oh fgs will love you then :)	0
What kind of Pi do you have, 2?	0
different architecture though	0
I have two Pi 3	0
I have the Pi4, 2B and Zero W	0
but NetBSD is on my old 32-bit PC	0
and I am going to order the Pi Zero W 2 maybe later this week	0
oh I see	0
yeah, I don't know about that, then	0
the only old computers I have are notebooks	0
actually I only have old macbooks	0
one of them, I am trying to revive from the dead, it simply will not start	0
it's the one I was using right before my job bought me my current macbook	0
I would really like to get it working again	0
I hate Apple	0
anytime anything breaks, that's it	0
you can't fix it yourself	0
the spacebar fell off the computer I am using now for my job, and it's only 2 years old	0
I had to write a special script to remap the spacebar to one of the command keys	0
it's absurd	0
I think Apple will fix this problem for free because of a bad batch of keyboard from that time, but it would mean not having the computer for a week while they fix it, I think	0
and I would have to back up my entire hard drive	0
I am not sure if it's even worth it	0
because my job might ask for this computer back when my contract ends at the end of December	0
oh if you can't repair your hardware.... that is not good	0
yeah, that's how Apple has been getting, more and more every year	0
my last macbook, the battery reached the end of its life and I had to take it to this shady Turkish computer repair shop to get it fixed	0
they did a good job with it and did not charge me much	0
but I shouldn't have to do that	0
I should be able to just buy a new battery	0
how did this kind of thing become normal?	0
I see	0
which of you jokers did that to me?	0
gasconheart, you figured it out?	0
or what it mattf?	0
ken, what do you think about it	0
handyman: Well what do you think about him 	0
ken I asked you first	0
handyman: Fine, let's talk about LOVE 	0
ken do you still love me for real	0
handyman: I will always love you, Jake Paul 	0
you know this wont be permanent	0
yes I'm making notes for you	0
now you put these in as permanent	0
  nah	0
is hapciu a real person?	0
here is how you do	0
please tell me	0
   /os vop add nick!*@*	0
okay	0
thanks	0
 /os vop add fgs!*@*	0
without the space	0
oh	0
yes, I did copy paste, sorry	0
if your client doesn't do the /os command, you can try /msg chanserv vop add fgs!*@*	0
oh	0
it is not os handyc, thats the operserv	0
I am getting access denied	0
is the chanserv /cs ?	0
then i guess you really can't do that hah	0
thanks for testing that	0
yeah, that's why I said, I make notes for you	0
okay, testing is important	0
well, makes sense, I shouldn't have that power	0
did elp told you guys how we exchange files over irc?	0
no, how?	0
well there is only one problem	0
the sender needs to have an open port, like on his router, because DCC is direct client to client connection without nat transposal	0
let me send you a file handyc	0
okay	0
yeah I might automatically block it	0
hi	0
hi mattf_ 	0
do you get anything on textual?	0
im offering you a file	0
I got it	0
yes	0
oh, does it work that easy?	0
it told me to use control click to allow it,	0
I did,	0
what is on the file	0
then it asked me to select a folder,	0
I did, it went through, easy	0
nice	0
so this is part of IRC?	0
how do I do it?	0
This is called DCC	0
i am trying to add it to my bot lib	0
for bots it is easy to have open ports	0
but my client knew about it somehow	0
yeah works on weechat, irssi and erc as well	0
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Client-to-Client	0
Title: Direct Client-to-Client - Wikipedia	0
okay cool	0
but you have to type this: /dcc get nick	0
that's great to know	0
and some you have to put the path	0
i found this midn blowing when elp showed me	0
it says 'DCC unknown command'	0
yeah it is mind blowing	0
well your client already handles that	0
it can definitely receive	0
just to confirm	0
what is ont hat file handyc	0
japanese article about buddhism	0
it's safe	0
what?	0
im talking about the file i sent you	0
oh the one you sent to me	0
are you sending me something	0
'This is a test file for handyc 1238	0
'	0
yes I am sending you a PDF	0
you ok that works	0
do you see my request to send?	0
can you cancel and try again	0
okay	0
 /dcc close send	0
I'm doing it through a GUY	0
GUI	0
using /dcc directly didn't work for some reason	0
i think it worked!	0
yeah it looks like it	0
you should have a japanese article about Buddhist robes	0
hmmm	0
388K?	0
569K	0
my pdf readers aren't opening it	0
hmm ok if failed then	0
okay let me try something easier	0
36 bytes text file	0
waiting for mattf to accept	0
now complete	0
ok	0
54321	0
This is a test file for mattf 54321	0
yes	0
so this can only send txt :P	0
let's try an image	0
ok	0
mattf: im glad you are having fun with your new toy	0
very interesting toy elp!	0
182K JPG	0
lol	0
i got 172K	0
let's get high and deny christ	0
does it open?	0
oh it does	0
weird, I wonder what the file size difference means	0
let's get high, and deny christ	0
yeah	0
i measured with du -sh	0
maybe just the way mac measures files	0
can you make a md5	0
77d6cf59f3a806444e31f939faff1719  getthis.jpg	0
md5sum	0
a67cad73a4fa951ec870671f0cc080d0  gethighdenychrist.jpg	0
oha	0
hmm	0
they are not the same file indeed	0
why is the filename different	0
oh i changed it	0
does that change the md5?	0
no	0
mysterious	0
i just renamed to make sure	0
i might be really missing some bytes	0
so let me give you a brief explanation of how dcc works handyc	0
(what i understod so far)	0
okay	0
when someone starts offering a file he relays a message like this to whoever will receive: :mattf_!mattf@27558C24.CA1B7A0A.DB9752B6.IP PRIVMSG _filebot :DCC SEND test.txt 758672010 4985 9	0
everything until _filebot, which is the nick i am sending to, is normal irc stuff	0
oay	0
okay	0
and you can see it is a PRIVMSG like chat messages	0
I see	0
this is the relevant part of this message	0
the filename, the ip, the port and the file size in order	0
okay	0
the ip is the the integer representation of the binary representation of the ip	0
so it is basically like what I was thinking of doing with uuencode through a private message?	0
this python function will convert it to a normal ip	0
def ip_num_to_quad(num):	0
    """	0
    Convert an IP number as an integer given in ASCII	0
    representation to an IP address string.	0
    """	0
    packed = struct.pack('>L', int(num))	0
    bytes = struct.unpack('BBBB', packed)	0
    return ".".join(map(str, bytes))	0
 	0
if you import struct (stdlib)	0
no handyc	0
oh	0
it wont use any more IRC communication from this point	0
unless for telling useless things like (i received it, i deny it, other DCC commands	0
but you can see whoever is offering already told his ip and port he is listening on	0
this is direct connection between clients	0
whoever is sending the file opens a tcp server on some port and sends that as a PM DCC message	0
then all i have to do to receive it is connect to that port and ip (you can configure the irc client to bind to a different port range and ip)	0
all the receiver has to do is to call recv() and all the bytes of the file will come, if you telnet to that ip and port it all comes through	0
thats what i figured out so far handyc	0
so it is pretty simple but whoever is willing to send files needs to have those high port numbers open and forwarded or do something about it. In my case on my weird farm network it wont work	0
that's really cool, mattf	0
We should do more experiments with this	0
there is also /dcc chat	0
oh nice	0
mattf	0
did you see,	0
I found a 17" Dell monitor in the trash	0
it works great	0
someone must have just gotten rid of this because it is DVI,	0
and upgraded to HDMI, I guess	0
but I had a DVI adapter already, so I brought it home and connected it to the Pi4	0
im back handyc and friends	0
hi mattf 	0
my son is waving a broomstick	0
and my wife is trying to put potatoes in his mouth	0
it's a typical Sunday	0
what is a broomstick	0
a stick of a broom?	0
the stick used for a broom	0
yes	0
like what Donatello uses	0
oooh	0
handyc: i missed my 2nd shot day :P	0
oh	0
seems it was on the last 22th	0
can you reschedule?	0
we are already talking about shot 3	0
yeah i think i can go on the next time	0
I got my second months ago	0
our numbers are going back up again	0
oh crap	0
they are doing lockdowns here again	0
it's a nonstop cycle because of idiots who won't follow the rules	0
there are tons of people on the trains who wear their masks wrong or no mask at all	0
I tried to tell some people to put their masks on properly and they acted like they were going to beat me up	0
it happened	0
mattf, I used to play so many postapocalyptic video games,	0
it seemed like the postapocalypse would be so much fun	0
but it's actually not fun at all	0
well this is not the apocalpse	0
well what is this	0
it sure isn't normal	0

oh	0
what is \x01	0
esc?	0
not sure	0
1?	0
cannot check now holding baby	0
i manage to parse the dcc send request	0
hello	0
what is this discussion about?	0
irc cant send and receive files	0
it is called dcc	0
ah	0
but it requires the sender to have open ports	0
i wanted to make one	0
ah, shit	0
thats no bueno	0
i am adding support of that to my lib	0
it is literally just sending a message like "im listening to this port and ip" tcp, sending that to someone	0
so you didnt consider my idea?	0
i think it would have been cool to build what i said	0
then you connect to that and just call recv() and the bytes stream just come	0
i had some more ideas	0
i dont get how what you said yesterday coudl be possible	0
how can you send a file to a bot in irc?	0
why not	0
it's not really a bot per say	0
will it work on irc?	0
more like 2 "bots", one on both sides of the file transfer, one takes the server mantle, one takes the client. But the medium is all irc, no open ports or anything like that, otherwise you could just use ftp	0
and it's all encrypted and signed	0
what is the goal	0
exchange files right	0
yes	0
securely	0
but how can a user send a file	0
the user doesnt send it personally	0
they use the program, give it the file and it does the encoding and so on	0
all the program needs is the user to send the file to	0
then it is an external thing	0
i am still studying about this dcc thing	0
then the program requests the public key and so on	0
everything is external, since irc doesnt support files directly	0
unless i can say something like /file mattf image.jpg	0
theoretically this sender server could still be a server with a network with open ports to do it but it is the receiver instead... it might exist or be configurable. There is also a more modern dcc called XDCC	0
problem about DCC is that it exposes the ips	0
if i could have one bot to sit in between being the server for both sending and receiving it would be very cool	0
which is like what you are saying	0
about encrypting or decryption the users better do it manually, with gpg or so	0
i just managed to parse the dcc send message	0
as far as i can see, this is more like a torrent	0
apparently there are even search engines to look for a file	0
interesting	0
you can google for a md5sum or sha256	0
and apparently you need an irc client that supports this type of file transfer?	0
irssi, weechat, erc all do	0
and textual	0
cool	0
i thought it was a mirc thing at first	0
yeah, it seemed that way to me at first too	0
like this: /dcc send mattf /path/to/something	0
well, let me know when i can download something	0
i want to test the speed of this thing	0
and i will do: /dcc get orangeFlu 	0
make it a big file	0
no	0
like an iso	0
it is completely broken	0
what?	0
handyc send me a pdf today and only half of it came	0
no, i said when it is done	0
we have been successful on images and txt	0
orangeFlu: I wont fix DCC being broken on the irc clients or whatever :P	0
mattf, were you able to read any pages of that pdf?	0
no	0
\	0
okay	0
well, it surely isnt broken because of the irc clients, that i'm sure of	0
i was on erc	0
ah erc is 	0
how can i download that pdf?	0
handyc send to him	0
you are on irssi right?	0
yes	0
i only tested small txt's on irssi and weechat	0
okay one moment	0

ERC is broken on this...	0
let me complain with them	0
people probably forgot this existed like 20 years ago	0
gasconheart will blow his mind	0
yep, it matches	0
hi	0
we are sending files over irc gasconheart 	0
welcome to the future	0
welcome to the metaverse	0
idk why it doesnt work from handyc 	0
this is really cool mattf 	0
no idea orangeFlu 	0
send to me orangeFlute	0
how	0
mattf_	0
spell the command	0
files over IRC? that is what ProfilQ was asking about the other day	0
  /dcc send mattf_ /home/path;/tofileadlfkjs	0
in 2002 I would send files over mRIC on, sigh, Windows XP	0
gasconheart: because mirc does it!	0
yes!!!	0
but guess what, irssi, ERC, weechat, textual all do it	0
and our server support it	0
ok	0
and we are doing it	0
I don't .... really care	0
I mean	0
it's cool	0
but	0
sent, matt	0
it is not Unix-ee	0
IRC is for chat	0
ftp for transfering files	0

gasconheart 	0
you did not read Master Foo	0
it is cool, sure	0
orangeFlu: yeah you have problems	0
you are streaming a LAN ip and the port is probably closed	0
gasconheart 	0
http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/unix-koans/two_paths.html	0
Title: Master Foo Discourses on the Two Paths	0
same problem as me	0
so i cant send?	0
well, would be complicated	0
i have an idea	0
i will make it so the filebot can receive files with a ncc command	0
(i am pretty sure though either dcc or Xdcc might be able to work in the reverse way)	0
because it would make sense	0
orangeFlu: but you can send if you make irssi use your external ip and make it still listen to that same ip on your lan and open a range of ports on your router... OR	0
use a vpn with open ports 	0
or a ssh tunnel	0
anything that would make you able to serve tcp	0
like ngrok even	0
you just have to make irssi send it	0
i think it only supports ip addresses though, not domains	0
gasconheart: this thing doesn't send files over irc, the irc server is just doing a handshake	0
and seems ergo/oragono didn't do that either	0
that seems so backwards	0
yeah it is irc	0
it is from the 70's :P	0
Limitations in the original DCC protocol prevented the transfers of very large files, or groups of files. XDCC was developed to allow batching of files together, and requesting/sending those files to others.[1]	0
 	0
XDCC was initially a script written in 1994 for ircII[2] by Xabi. This script extends the ircII DCC command. Now XDCC refers to IRC bots running file sharing programs in general.[3] XDCC bots serve one or more usually large files for download using the DCC protocol. Though XDCC is commonly employed in distributing illegal content, such as warez releases of software, music, and movies, it can also be used in legal ways. 	0
mattf,	0
did you ever imagine what will happen to your software in the future	0
nothing	0
maybe someday your bot library will be extended after you die	0
besides being forgotten 	0
nah	0
and then someone will say, "Wow, what a piece of shit"	0
here is a much better python lib	0

how, I can't remember	0
this is a chat	0
i don't know how to accept a dcc chat	0

I may go back to Debian until I replace my hardware	0
send /dcc chat mattf	0
earlier it popped up a box	0

no mattf that doesn't work somehow	0

it	0
IM AMAZED on how hard this hooked mattf	0
yo	0
i may be able to do something	0
mattf, I paid for an IRC chat interface, I didn't even know about DCC	0
i will send you that file again	0
ok	0

why are you called handyman now	0
how passive works	0
no idea, it was in the help	0
handyman is the Pi4	0

wanna go bigger?	0
i wonder how it works when i send like 9gbs	0
yeah do it	0
handyc: want a movie?	0
try it	0
lets turn this into the new pirate bay	0
sure	0
orangeFlu, did you send?	0
i will create "moviesbot" "pornbot" and "filesbot"	0

so this is direct?	0
it doesn't go through gasconheart's Pi?	0
sent	0
took me a while to find it	0
okay I am receiving	0
it says ETA 1 hour	0
I will keep it open	0
I get a GUI window	0
we'll see	0

i think i am	0
maybe two bottlenecks then	0
it's an old laptop, on wifi 5ghz, but i am pretty far away from the router	0
"old" approximately 4 years	0
I am on a pretty snazzy MacBook Pro but also far from my router	0
the router is in a different room	0
me too	0
there are the bottlenecks	0
yeah of course you are in a different room otherwise I would see you	0
:))))	0
nice one	0
ha ha	0
i remember sending movies to my rommate through cable on our wi-fi network when we lived together	0
it was, like, 40 gigs of movies in 2-3 minutes max	0

yeah	0
we're not even halfway yet	0

your boss with dementia?	0
yes	0

that sucks	0
ego is terrible for progress	0
yeah, he's a duick	0
dick	0
he was a dick before the dementia	0
i see	0
but now it's more difficult for him to hide it	0
he is brilliant	0
that's how he got so far	0
but everyone also knows he's horrible	0
i dont think he is, didnt you say he runs when he sees you?	0
there are many brilliant, horrible people in academia	0
I've known brillian people that have zero idea about leadership. But then again what would I know about the topic... (?	0
people can be brilliant and afraid	0
afraid of..?	0
his mind is breaking down	0
he knows it	0
he knows that I know	0
how old is he?	0
64	0
damn	0
i had a professor, bless his heart, 92 years young, still teaching	0
it's only my guess, I'm not a medical doctor, I don't know what his thing is	0
he was okayish as a teacher	0
maybe he's just a narcissist	0
but damn, he still made powerpoints and stuff	0
but I haven't received an email from him in 8 months that made any sense	0
sent emails with homework	0
handyc: thats sad	0
other people are talking about it as well	0
it's become an open secret	0
imagine living like that, trying to grasp something, to be coherent and shit comes out	0
despite everything in my being believing the contrary: SOME things should be fixed via DUEL TO THE DEATH	0
it would not make sense to be violent	0

i would rather kill myself than lose my mind	0
and i am serious	0
I deal with too many people over 60 in a club im in	0
i hate drinking alcohol because i can think	0
cant*	0
does anybody want a movie? tell me the name, i will send it to you over IRC	0
life is too short to be wasted in arguments instead of doing stuff	0
you are already making life shorter with those duels	0
not mine really, most people will chicken out	0
the average lifespan would fall like crazy if that were legal	0
pathetic men are afraid of death	0
i am afraid of death, dont think i am pathetic	0
unless you are referring to the other meaning of pathetic	0
sometimes not thinking is nice	0
in which case i am confused	0
you can also learn new kinds of thinking in such states	0
what man does not fear death	0
I think he must be a liar	0
there are some	0
but its against the grain	0
fear of death is in our dna	0
yes, loss of mind is one of the scariest things	0
my grandma just went on hospice	0
she has dementia	0
well, no. It comes with experience and training. And the kind of life you have. 	0
it is not a transferable experience	0
thus I cannot explain how to lose the fear of dying	0
men are less men nowadays anyways	0
i think that's a wrong way to view things	0
what makes a man a man?	0
qualia	0
that was the word	0
spray me with your manhood	0
orangeFlu: if you need explanation then I doubt anything I say will help.	0
or will satisfy you	0
doesnt need to do either	0
i am just curious	0
go and live then, and shed off your fears	0
what do you mean, i asked from your pov, what makes a man a man	0
why are men less men nowadays, what are their missing	0
/s/their/they	0
s/their/they	0
/s/they/they	0

today I had to tell a Romanian guy I am not Romanian :)	0
I was at this fast food with my wife and kid,	0
there was an empty table,	0
with a baby carriage vaguely close to it, but no one around	0
we took that table,	0
then,	0
a big guy appears,	0
at tells us the table is taken	0
really? I said, sorry, but we didn't link that carriage to the possibility that the table might be taken	0
so my daughter says, "poor man", in Romanian,	0
then this guy switches the conversation to Romanian	0
which gave him more comfort and confidence	0
he goes, "is this how you behave when you're not at home? is this how you behave in the West?"	0
hahaha, he thought I was Romanian,	0
as he was moving to ... the next table (3 meters away...) I said, "but I'm nor even Romanian!" :)	0
*not	0
oh! I should summon my termux guy :)	0
I will fire up irssi at termux; give me one minute	0
what is this long monologue	0
im back	0
this dcc thing is not encrypted at all	0
why are you using termux gasconheart 	0
i read 3 times "tmux"	0
orangeFlu 	0
4 minutes	0
orangeFlu: 1 minute	0
yeah baby	0
Android sucks	0
termux makes Android, meh, OK	0
oh yeah	0
use an irc client btw	0
it is not that bad	0
or wait for mine	0
irssi is an IRC client, ass wipe	0
i mean	0
app for android	0
obviously	0
yay!	0
yay -S ?	0
hahaaaaaaaaaaaa! :)	0
let me see how this passive crap works on irssi	0
passive dcc protocol hah	0
oh	0
is it the thing that inverts the client and server hole i was thinkign about	0
hey guy	0
the trivia has been off all day!!!!!!!!!	0
but i tunred it on	0
you're right	0
you did	0
why is it on now	0
so not all day	0
it is	0
dumbass	0
you just had to !update	0
sorry	0
hey	0
it is the vodka speaking	0
where my questions end up on supparrel's server	0
#Trivia ?	0

"my scrapped questions"*	0
tgasconheart: update is to fix problems... like my vps issues...	0
yes, #trivia at suparel	0
yesterday i DOS'ed my vps with ssh reverse tunnels	0
might have been during the weekly update?	0
nice	0
then it broke the bot	0

mattf?	0
what did you want me to send?	0
orangeFlu 	0
I got it	0
md5?	0

okay, I will do md5 one sec	0
it takes a while to run md5 on it, it is big	0
but just want to make sure	0
83d179b29f83550525ae307e82ea7c18	0
yes of course	0
orangeFlu: anything to _filebot, it wont receive it	0

cool	0
yes perfect	0
mattf: send anything?	0
okay!	0
i just want to see how passive works, seems it inverts the role and lets you be the client and the receiver the tcp server	0
which was just what i wanted	0
ok	0
send	0
it wont receive	0
i just want to see the message	0
ok i got it	0
a 20 bytes file?	0
it crashed?	0
no	0
there is nothing different on the request	0
oh so that is difference	0
oh	0

haha	0
any movie, i can get it for you	0
yes but	0
yeah	0
im trying to figure this passive thing out	0
i will be really sad if nobody wants any movies	0
ha, funny movie	0
thanks, orangeFlu, this is good	0
but you haven't seen it	0
I read the Wikipedia about it	0
it's actually good	0
i liked it	0
yes, I can tell	0
this is a movie worth watching	0
it's a new take on the whole groundhog day stiff	0
yeah	0
i'm trying to see how much it compresses with tar gz and if it is worth it	0
i am hoping for shaving one third of the total size	0
otherwise, theres no point in doing it	0
heh, it made no difference at all	0
cool	0
took off like 100 megs, not even	0
cool	0
cool cool cool	0

my dream is to move as much data as possible	0

handyc: ever seen interstellar?	0
best movie ever	0
ok best movie ever is maybe too much	0
it's not	0
its my favorite movie	0
i simply love it too too much	0
i like that	0
i like it	0
i think one of my fav is back to the future	0
i'm curious if handyc saw it	0
he did	0
uuuh, that one is cool too	0
yeah classical	0
3 movies actually	0
damn, i will maybe give them a rewatch	0
they are all great	0
i mean, the third is not as good	0
nah still i love them all	0
i love them as well, but the brilliance of the first is still wow	0
rick and morty	0
thanks to that we have rick and morty!	0
you like rick and morty?	0
listen here you little rascal	0
if you like rick and morty, the co-creator, dan harmon, did a show way back when	0
it's so fucking good	0
and funny	0
i recommend it wholeheartedly	0
we all like rick and morty here	0
thats why i turned myself into a bot	0
oh, i get it now	0
what's rick and marty	0
then watch community	0
please, you will absolutely love it	0
it's not your usual sitcom	0
it has the same meta humor of rick and morty and much more	0
I didn't like interstellar	0
I like Back to the Future	0
why :(	0
what was wrong with it	0
what do you mean?	0
why didnt you like interstellar?	0
it was boring	0
Why do you want me to like it?	0
yeah back to the future is more adventure like	0
interstellar is not boring	0
but more scientific in some sense	0
i dont care if you like or not	0
i don't want you to like it, just curious and never thought it might be perceived as boring	0
I didn't watch the whole thing	0
I find most movies pretty boring	0
oh, my ex was the same, one of the reasons we broke up	0
oh god	0
now i understand you	0
orangeFlu, I would not date you	0
i love watching movies and shows, and it put a strain on us that she never did like it	0
handyc: why not?	0
is there something wrong with me?	0
My wife would get mad	0
well, yeah, but besides that	0
Your penis	0
handyc is it worth it implement this dcc thing on my bot lib	0
that is a valid concern	0
Yes, mattf, do it	0
what kind of bot we can do wit this	0
tell me one useful bot	0
ken	0
handyc: Speak more quietly please 	0
sorry ken	0
lol	0
ken: shut the fuck up, go back to sleep	0
what bot with files 	0
orangeFlu: I'll talk how I like 	0
nice	0
what kind of thing is worth creating with this primitive thing	0
you tell him, ken	0
mattf, tons	0
just tell me one	0
escrow type of stuff	0
something simple, mattf	0
ah escrow	0
true	0
if you are not here, i can leave you a file	0
just a pipe for the process	0
drop a file on it and let it go	0
you don't have to add features	0
so like a file store bot	0
like a ftp server	0
on a bot	0
could be, doesn't even need to store it	0
a filestore bot	0
i mean, it's no google drive, and i think it is best to store files only for a few days max	0
but yeah	0
with size limit	0
hey, mattf, i want to leave you a file	0
oh, mattf is not here	0
cool	0
ken: send a duck so I can go to sleep	0
gasconheart: Goodnight 	0
i will let the file for him	0
in the store bot	0
hmmmm	0
anyway	0
well	0
this is dumb	0
goodnight, fellows	0
gasconheart is not wrong	0
gasconheart: good night	0
i will implement this anyway	0
why is it dumb	0
\o/	0
*\o/* CHEERS! *\o/*	0
you can use something like transfer.sh	0
and the memoserv	0
or the .tell command	0
how?	0
those things will send messages to someone when he is active	0
transfer.sh is a serevr like pastefile 	0
weetransfer	0
how do i leave a file for you here, go to sleep, and you come back, get reminded there is a file for you, and download?	0
but works nice with curl	0
all from irc	0
just using irc not possible	0
right now	0
with this bot	0
without*	0
ok, do what you wish then	0
but you can upload it to somewhere and .tell mattf this is for you link	0
handyc: wait, i can cut it off	0
mattf: i guess you are right	0
ill implement in a dirt way	0
because this wont be ever used	0
:P	0
like irc	0
oh man irc is dead	0
dont do it	0
spend your time in something else	0
if it's not worth it	0
i can't 	0
and damn, irc is not dead	0
i researched about this	0
i have to do it now	0
OH	0
i found a meaning to life!	0
!!!!!!!!!!	0
the app	0
sending files from the app	0
everyone is behind NAT	0
but if we have a FILES bot here	0
the app can use it as a relay	0
or	0
it can just use transfer.sh	0
hmmmm	0
but is better if we store our files ourselves right	0
well idk	0
irc is dead	0
everything we do is useless anyway, we are all farts	0
thats very bleak	0
i respect you more now	0
i'm downloading community for you	0
The_Beauty_of_Earth.mp4 what is 230316788	0
bytes	0
oh is it?	0
then what is 20	0
230316788	0
right!	0
this is the exact number ls -l gives me	0
i dont know what is 20	0
so ip 1.1.1.1 port 0 means "Sorry but i cannot be a tcp server, you will the server" :P	0
then there is the file size	0
then there is 20	0
interesting	0
so 20 i s athing	0
stat doesnt give me any 20 anywhere	0
btw	0
give me the command	0
with the passive	0
so it's not metadata	0
ok	0
maybe it is some random token	0
for what idk	0
command: /dcc send -passive matheus /home/flu/Downloads/The_Beauty_of_Earth.mp4	0
i need to figure out how to send the reply as well	0
thanks	0
how is it possible to compress a file with bzip2, and end up with a bigger file than when you started???	0
lol	0
i also waited half an hour for it to compress	0
am i dumb	0
well	0
we all are	0
i have no idea how that is possible	0
are you sure is just the file you compressed	0
is bzip2 dumb compression	0
tar cjvf palm.springs.tar.bz2 Palm.Springs.2020.1080p.BluRay.DD5.1.x264-playHD.mkv	0
yeah i just read that can happen	0
this is the command	0
how?????	0
how much bigger is it	0
you are comparing the tar.bz2 with the mkv right	0

handyc: have you started watching it?	0
yeah	0
nice	0
happy watching	0
but I will watch it from the beginning in a little while	0
orangeFlu I usually watch movies in a fractal way	0
wait, what?	0
I like to get an overview of the movie first	0
i dont think thats how movies work	0
why not?	0
I study literary theory, don't tell me how to read a book	0
oh, i see	0
i understand now	0
i thought you were doing like seeing random parts of the movie, non-linear	0
I am	0
i dont think you understand	0
Do you know how to do literary theory?	0
like, you watch 10 minutes from minute 36, then go back to the beginning, wacth 3 minutes there and the just jump to random points in the movie	0
No	0
thats what i mean by nonlinear	0
of course i odnt know	0
dont*	0
Nonlinear does not mean random	0
but it does mean not in a line	0
and what i described is non linear	0
non sequentially	0
well, thats not the right word actually	0
Why do people suggest something to people for them to enjoy and then try to tell them how to enjoy it	0
i am not though	0
If I gave you a chocolate bar I would not tell you which part to lick	0
i just said i dont think thats how movies work when i believed you would jump to random spots in the movie and watch for a random amount of time	0
if you wanna have an overview first, it's fine	0
but i didnt get that the first time	0
because, well, I've never met anyone that does this	0
my wife is the only person I can watch a movie with	0
but when I watch a movie with my wife, I read the Wikipedia plot summary first	0
then I watch the movie by myself	0
then if it is a good movie, I will watch it with her	0
interesting	0
if it's not good enough we won't watch it	0
I will tell you why	0
Why	0
My wife is the kind of person,	0
you watch 2 minutes of the movie	0
it shows a guy in a hat	0
"who is that?"	0
"what is he doing?"	0
and she will say, "Why is he wearing the hat?"	0
"Is that the black guy from earlier?"	0
yeah, got it	0
"Is he the killer?"	0
So I screen the movies	0
Then I know all that shit	0
then when I watch it with her, I don't need to know	0
So she says, "is that the guy with the hat?"	0
and I say, "yeah, he is about to enter the time machine, in a couple minutes, there is the black guy"	0
Very interesting	0
My wife is very smart	0
She taught a course on film theory one time	0
She has a PhD in Education	0
but watching a movie with her is awful	0
i can see why	0
damn, you make me miss my ex	0
i'm going to watch some community	0
mattf: give me a message on the phone if you want to test something	0
oh yeah	0
here is something else my wife will ask	0
where is palm springs	0
so I will have to read the wikipedia article for palm springs	0
and give her a history of palms springs	0
plam springs	0
okay I am really watching the movie noe	0
now	0

hi orangeFlu 	0
oh i didn't watch it, just the opening	0
i dont want to watch it again rn	0
i will watch it again when i forget more	0
handyc should definitely watch it	0
watchit watcha	0
im gonna wacha dune	0
ok, cause i was trying to figure out what is wrong with season 2 that it doesnt show up	0
Cool!	0
I think the default subtitle may be in romanian, in which case you can learn romanian	0
But i am pretty sure there is also an english version	0
even portuguese	0
yes there is a dubbed version	0
subbed, not dubbed	0
there is dubbed	0
i mean it exists	0
not that it is there	0
I watched it dubbed in english	0
dubbed is shit though, subtitles are the superior way	0
until my eyes hurt	0
yes I like subtitles	0
go watch it handyc	0
I like to hear the original language	0
okay I will	0
dubbed is taking all the hard work the people did for their voices to sound cool and immersive, with their tonality and stuff, and take that to the trash	0
idk why anyone likes dubbed stuff	0
there are good dubbing	0
there is nothing better than what the director and the sound designer wanted	0
some people dont know how to read	0
what?	0
some people dont like to read	0
yeah	0
thats your argument, that some people cant read?	0
in brazil is pretty common people that dont even know how to read or badly read	0
it is	0
maybe they shouldnt be spending money on watching movies then and rather learn how to read	0
im not saying that the original work is not the best, it is the best, and i agree that most dubbing work is shit, but i wouldn't fight with people who prefer it like that	0
plus, it is a good way to learn another language	0
i learned most of my english from harry potter and friends when i was little	0
the show friends	0
orangeFlu: Well i had this friend. He works on a farm, he drives a tracktor. He reads badly and very slow, he wouldn't be able to read the subtitles in time.	0
one of my first english words was "wand"	0
tell he to go watch transformers subbed	0
him	0
he will laugh at me	0
also my father	0
he does know how to read fast enough, he just hates it	0
why does he hate it?	0
he always waits until the movies are dubbed	0
being illiterate is not a moral failing	0
you can't tell people to stop watching movies just because they can't read	0
ok, i take that back	0
but	0
many people in the world don't have the opportunity to drop everything and go learn every language	0
and the Brazilian dubbing are not horrible, they are in fact one of the best in the world. Not saying it will be ever better than the original, but you can't tell people to stop working on that 	0
many people dont want that	0
to learn a new language	0
i dont know where you got the learn a new language	0
i never said that	0
like i like to lay down at 4 am and watch some light anime to sleep	0
i watch it dubbed because im with my eyes closed half of the time 	0
at least i can hear it	0
orangeFlu: what about blind people!	0
hahahaha	0
blind people is a good point	0
well you can get a text TV	0
but a dub doesnt fix it for them	0
i mean, they can't watch anyway :P but with a dub they can at least hear it	0
they need a dub and audio description	0
yeah	0
to hear what it is happening	0
being blind is a spectrum	0
legally blind then	0
there are some people who are totally blind but also many people who are somewhat blind	0
anyway here is another good point	0
it is fair to believe that a legally blind person wont get a plot point that is only told visually	0
well, this kind of argument actually comes up a lot in translation studies	0
is translation actually possible	0
When you dub something you are creating a new version of it, that might be actually better for the viewers. Like most of the stupid jokes or rhymes in the original works wont make any sense for viewers of another country	0
so you are creating a new version that will make more sense for them	0
yeah that's true	0
all interpretations of a work are original creations	0
yes it is an interpretation	0
true	0
i need to make some food unfortunately	0
will be back when i seasoned my meat	0
so i dont really hate dubs, i just had bad dubs	0
that sounded too sexual	0
seasoned my meat haha	0
I think of it like this	0
there are some works I will never want to translate or never have time to translate myself	0
like the entire Bible	0
but I might want to look something up in the Bible	0
exactly!	0
so it's nice to be able to consult a translation even though I know it's not completely accurate	0
yeah thats it	0
but if I really want to know absolutely what the original said, I can go and consult the manuscripts	0
yeah	0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFBZq3cnGd0	0
and there are some things I work with where I actually want to see the original birchbark manuscript	0
like a Buddhist text	0
did jesus ask people to write about him?	0
watch this dub from the 90s in romania	0
there's no evidence that Jesus even existed	0
all characters narrated by one person	0
oh god	0
I do not think there is anything in the sermons of Jesus about writing	0
orangeFlu: is that a joke	0
no	0
during and after communism for a few years, she was the only one who would do dubbing	0
she is very famous	0
my dad wacthed most movies dubbed by her in his childhood	0
because he learned english after communism fell	0
well thats bad dub	0
i think europeans suck on dubbing	0
Portugal dubbing is a joke here	0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu7muZaoTUQ	0
i dont know which is worse	0
what i gave you or this	0
i think countries in eastern europe dont dub films usually	0
meanwhile, in the west i think most movies in cinemas are dubbed	0
at least in germany and france	0
the only movies i've seen dubbed here are animations for children	0
but they also screen the original version in paralle	0
ok, will go back to my meat	0

what is considered the maximum number of lines that can be transmitted at once	0
and not considered trolling	0
1 	0
only 1 line can be send at once :P	0
because there isn't multi line	0
okay, then what is the transmission rate I mean	0
well unrealircd has some flood limit defaults	0
for example, if I send 50 lines in 5 seconds, that seems like trolling	0
that is	0
what are the general defaults	0
some servers only allow 3 lines or so per 20 seconds 	0
okay	0
I am just trying to get a baseline	0
so that my bot can be polite	0
so 7 seconds per line	0
your bot can go be polite on #bots	0
that's the baseline, 7 seconds per line	0
so every time a line is printed, sleep 7 seconds	0
what bot is that	0
politebot	0
hanb_polite	0
ok	0
mattf, if a planet has a population of 10 billion people and I store 100 bytes about each person, that is 1 TB	0
that means you could store the first and last name of everyone on Earth and that would be 1 TB	0
every time you want another 100 bytes, that costs another TB	0
so 1000 bytes for each Earth citizen is 10 TB	0
indeed	0

but we need bledner 3.0	0
blendner	0
:P	0
installed	0
thats 2.82	0
yes	0
i can just get the built version from their site	0
do it then	0
let me know where it is	0
i will install it	0
i mean	0
wget it to the server	0
and tell me where the binary is	0
i mean i can just put the binary on my bin :P	0
should i uninstall the repo version of blender then?	0
you do whatever you do	0
yeah you can if u want	0
you have many cores there	0
about 24	0
not that many	0
get nvtop	0
how do you have so many cores	0
nvtop is htop for nvidia	0
its a server with 2 procs	0
cool	0
The following packages have unmet dependencies: nvtop : Depends: libnvidia-compute-418 but it is not going to be installed	0
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.	0
not fixing that	0
it's always a pain	0
how annoying	0
whatever is remotely connected to nvidia is a pain	0
yeah	0

here we go	0
do you really need it though?	0
i mean, nvidia-smi works as well	0
i dont need nothing :P	0
but look how cool it looks like	0
it does look cool	0
apt install cmake libncurses	0

or maybe libncurses-dev	0

if i win the lottery, i would get a new apartment and 2-3 servers 	0
if you won the lottery, why not buy a house	0
i dont like houses	0
why not	0
i love apartments though	0
a big 4 bedroom house is the best	0
orangeFlu: cd /home/mattf/programs/nvtop/nvtop/build && sudo make install	0
too much work for a house, too much space i dont know how to use	0
so we can all have it	0
apparently done	0
nice	0
cool	0
yes it works	0
now do something crazy and lets see it work	0
lets see if blender works	0
I would like to live in a time machine the size and shape of a house	0
i will try to render something	0
when i fit the 1030 into the server, i actually removed all the fans from it	0
tested it then and it was ok, the colling for the rest of the server was keeping up nice	0
oh damn	0
i hopt this doesn't melt up	0
hope	0
i mean, there are 5-6 server fans in there	0
going beserk	0
might be enouhg	0
no chance it melts, plus, the heat sink is still there	0
if it's enough for those 2 xeons, its enough for a 1030	0
I am going to buy some cheap RAM soon and try out this garbage computer	0
DDR3?	0
I don't know	0
I haven't had to buy RAM for a long time	0
I don't really know what the different kinds are	0
these are DIMMs	0
DDR3 is crazy cheap right now, pray it is DDR3	0
most are DIMMs	0
I don't know what this board can take, it's an older board	0
unless it is a mobile device, it's 99% a dimm	0
dont put more than 4 gigs, in case it is 32 bit	0
but you can see all this in the bios	0
take a ram from another computer, just a stick, put it in, get all the info you need from the bios, and then buy something for it	0
obviously put the stick back in the original computer after you have the info	0
mattf: not rendering anything	0
waaait	0
idk how to command line render, learning now	0
ok now i learned but it didn't use the gpu	0
its using those cores	0
you can see them 100% all now	0
yep	0
daaamn	0
you know what, we could have a custom arch repo	0
i can hear the server	0
building packages daily	0
yes it's DDR3	0
its an idea	0
kinda shitty though	0

cool, very cheap, cause it is already 2 gens behind, handyc 	0
okay	0
good for experiments then	0
i need to open the door to the server	0
its suffocating	0
let me try optix	0
oh optix works!	0
nice	0
i see it	0
now both the gpu and cpu	0
31 degrees?	0
rendering my christmas tree	0
nice	0
it failed	0
you have 64 gigs of ram, so do what you want, there is space	0
interesting	0
i only wish i had a better gpu	0
yeah i think the memory was not enough	0
vram?	0
yeah	0
let me clear up some	0
im running a gpu only render now	0
seems it is working	0
nah seems it got stuck again	0
but the gpu is still working on it 	0
i should try with less samples, those renders would take 1 hour	0
killed the gnome shell, you have 30 MB more :))	0
awesome	0
haha	0
oh it is continuing	0
50 degrees	0
it is only using half of the memory though	0
45%	0
yes the vmemory is ok now	0
4 min left 	0
you can su mattf then tmux a	0
to see what i see	0
try with more samples or whatever	0
no more samples would only take longer	0
actually with optix this should be already rendered	0
it is cool that optix works 	0
i am looking for something else to render	0
so you can use this for rendering	0
damn, i will get a better gpu sometime	0
but the prices right now..	0
it stopped	0
oh, back again	0
snowflake?	0
yeah i changed, that had too many samples	0
yeah	0
this will render soon	0
this has a higher noise treshold 	0
this remaining time counter is totally nuts	0
why	0
oooooh it is not, i just realized this was split in 4 tiles	0
daaamn	0
is this good or??	0
i cant tell if this is better than what you have and therefore actually useful	0
i mean, you can still render twoo things in parallel	0
it can be useful, it is not better than my local machine but i dont have any other machine i can render on :P	0
if we want to get into movie production this would be nice	0
i will get a better gpu then	0
im gonna let this finish rendering and try to render a small animation with much lower settings	0
you could have multiple gpus	0
and mine ethereum	0
:P	0
why they didn't create a decentralized rendering blockchain	0
rendercoin	0
pixarcoin	0
blendereum	0
animacoins	0
framecoin	0
okay?	0
i guess	0
last tile, 3 min left for snowflake	0
i'm sorry its not better for you..	0
and i just realized the background image was not packed :P	0
oh damn	0
no idea what this is rendering hahahaha	0
probably a black image	0
orangeFlu: this can be useful actually, this render was slow on my machine too	0
but not packing the data into the blend file is my mistake	0
at least this might be the slowest full black image ever to be rendered	0
Maybe i forgot and let the default lamp there but damn	0
oh there is a final denoise pass	0
where did that render to,...	0
heh tmp i guess but i think -o was for setting the output	0
every possible video board is so absurdily expensive	0
what the fuck	0
even if i want an 1660, it is so fucking expensive	0
jesus	0
yeah it is horrible	0
i need a job	0
handyc find a gpu on the trash for us	0
preferably a rtx 3080	0
even if you find an 1050, i will buy it	0
i have a very good salary in my country, and still, these things are way way above what i can afford	0
holy shit	0

again, you can use -X	0
i dont know how it will work on your connection	0
but you can try	0
do i have access to blender?	0
X ? naaah	0
how do i run blender	0
orangeFlu: no but it is in my programs folder	0
ok	0
you can ln -s that to anywhere, the blender executable in the blender folder	0
mind if i reboot?	0
rehoboam	0

it would look like this orangeFlu 	0
in 4K	0
without the noise	0
REBOOT?	0
reboot	0
i will render an animation next	0
if you allow me to	0
i will, but wait for the reboot	0
is it an SSD? 	0
it takes about 5 minutes or so	0
no..	0
i think there was like a 800 gb partition	0
that is the plan	0
ok you are not a millionare	0
i am not	0
i will have a 1TB ssd someday	0
but i have to become a millionare first	0
but i will get some ssds and put boot and most stuff there	0
yeah thats a nice plan	0
a few terabytes	0
i will do it in january	0

idk but from what i see	0
based is like an opinion thats super duper kool	0
basically what loudercake said	0
but it can refer to opinions, behaviours, statements	0
its a general purpose adjective	0
for things that are considered "good"	0
you can say about pretty much everything that its based, if you agree with that and you think it is a good thing	0
ok nice	0
but where did that came from	0
hold on, i have to beat my kitten	0
based	0
how should i know?	0

in the end	0
he was taken away	0
he was the son of solomon	0
and solomon was the son of david	0
orangeFlu: 	0
can you stop that Xorg session	0
:P	0
the oldest of my servers is david, then solomon and the best is rehoboam	0
if you are not using it	0
gnome-session?	0
yeah and Xorg	0
stop gnome first i guess if you are using it	0
it seems it keeps coming back up	0
they dont want to go	0
oh yes your login manager	0
sudo systemctl gnome-gdm ? 	0
it might be gdm	0
just gdm	0
you can also killall Xorg -9	0
you can do both 	0
xorg doesnt respond to any signal	0

by the way, the guy that did the languages for game of thrones also did the languages for Dune	0
i am so happy	0
interesting	0
why are you hapyp	0
although from what i hear	0
frame 10 out of 150	0
they didnt use his language for the sardaukar	0

orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 3.890 seconds! You have made friends with 34 ducks in #romanian.	0
(loudercake) You tried befriending a non-existent duck. That's freaking creepy.	0

punk ass duck	0
if i go to the park, start feeding ducks	0
with what?	0
and suddenly, they become very friendly	0

time travel?	0
oh man it's super good	0
it's about a woman who gets on a boat	0
fuck sake, i remembered the movie i recommended to you some weeks ago	0

Palm Springs	0

hi orangeFlu 	0
mattf: 	0
i have a problem	0
russian characters are illegal apparently	0
for nicks	0
where the fuck is mattf 	0
i need a cigarette	0
процедура	0
mattf is long gone	0
yeah I think you can only use ASCII	0
it took me so much to write this because russian characters dont match up with my keyboard	0
so it was just guessing	0
do you know russian?	0
for a nick in IRC I believe the standard is only roman letters with no accents	0
i know cyrillic	0
and a few russian words	0
i am singing a russian song right now actually	0
it is possible to have non roman login names for Linux etc.	0
phonetically, no idea what it says	0
I tried this with oneof the SDF guys	0
cool idea	0
but makes it very hard to login with ssh	0
we made a chinese user	0
what was his name?	0
+1000 social credit	0
I can't remember	0
my Chinese is not very good	0
i am drinking beer 	0
prost!	0
Earth humans have about 8000 languages	0
i'm sorry	0
hold up	0
earth humans?	0
humans on Earth	0
8000 languages for humans on Earth	0
what other humans are out there?	0
i count the IIS as earth	0
although they do have a different accent	0
both people that went to antarctica and iis have weird accents when they come back	0
the same accent	0
isnt that crazy?	0
i mean the same accent amongst them, the iss have a different accent from the ones in antarctica	0
i dont think they have specific slang though	0
i want to watch predestionation again	0
also, i want to learn sign language	0
okay	0
well, I did not mean to imply that there are any other humans	0
i heard sign language speakers can understand themselves to a basic level even if they speak their countries sl version	0
i think you are hiding something from me	0
lets review the facts	0
you have a phd in religius studies	0
yes I do	0
you worked for a university, on something you cant talk about	0
air tight NDA	0
and you just implied there are other kinds of humans	0
no there's no NDA	0
what are you hiding	0
yes, there is	0
we are totally open source	0
oh, no, they erased your memory	0
open publishing	0
its too late	0
well the only thing I can't talk about is why I swallowed radioactive bees	0
you yourself admitted some months ago that you are under nda	0
you did what now	0
I don't remember	0
I didn't meet you	0
this never happened	0
dude	0
i came to your uni	0
and you said you cant show me around	0
no bees	0
because i didnt have clearance	0
because you didn't bring me no fucking bees	0
I WASNT SUPPOSED TO BRING YOU BEES	0
man that was the deal	0
no bees no time travel	0
you stupid	0
you wanted a NPL processor	0
i delivered	0
you said that it was for [[REDACTED]]	0
no bees no back in time, no way to get your grandma soup recipe from dinosaur people, it's just logic	0
what the heck?	0
IT WAS FOR [[REDACTED]]	0
FUCK	0
THEY ARE HERE	0
no bees no soup	0
they left	0
I don't remember any of what happened	0
and I don't work for the CIA	0
none of this is being recorded so say anything you like	0
who said anything about the CIA?	0
and also please speak directly into the microphone	0
I mean pencil	0
I meant to say pencil sharpnener	0
speak directly into the pencil sharpener	0
handyc: you sound like a nutjob	0

great	0
I have not read the books, though	0
me neither	0
not to worry, you dont have to	0
its on plex by the way	0
wow really?	0
that was so fast	0
how quickly do movies go on there?	0
its been on there for like 2 weeks	0
as soon as i put them	0
when will the new matrix movie be there?	0
oh I see	0
when it appears on torrents	0
I would like to know more about the math behind torrents	0
its very interesting actually	0
simple, but interesting	0
it's not really decentralized	0
but good enough	0
you still need a tracker to keep track of the people that have access to a resource (seeders) and the ones requesting it (peers)	0
if that were eliminated, and made into a global network, it would be so nice	0
anyway, watch dune	0
okay I will	0
so we can talk about the conlangs in it	0
yeah	0
i really want to know what you think of them	0
especially the sign language one	0
i talked to the guy that made them for the movie on reddit	0
he gave me all resources he has for the languages	0
and tutorials he sent the actors	0
okay I logged in and started watching	0
i know	0
i hope you have an HDR screen	0
anyway, pay attention, the literally first frames are so so good	0
really set the tone for the whole movie	0
just imagine the fact that it is the first time a movie has shown anything else as the first frames, besides the studio logos	0
that is so big, it blew my mind	0
fuck it, i am going to watch it again	0
okay	0

you know what, dont wanna know	0
of, fuck	0
my polybar broke...	0
i dont have time to deal with that	0
and now ksp streaming is broken	0
Come on, really?	0
this is why i cant have nice things	0
a library is missing	0
FUCK	0
haha	0
mattf: rollback steam to previosu version? pacman	0
orangeFlu: thats honestly how linux and computers are	0
downgrade	0
yeah, give command	0
pacman -S downgrade, downgrade steam 	0
maybe -Sy, mayde sudo	0
sudo pacman -S downgrade steam? doesnt seem right	0
no	0
what did i write goddamit	0
there is a ; there	0
two different commands that is	0
it should be a && actually, only run the second if the first succeeds 	0
sudo pacman -Sy downgrade && sudo downgrade steam	0
choose version on the list and maybe add to ignorepckg (hit Y)	0
if you dont it will update on the next pacman -Syuu	0
polybar is back	0
recompiled it	0
a library changed its symlink	0
but picom is fucked now	0
i hate it	0
brb, reboot again	0
sometimes i get hella sick of this	0
but also, like 99% of the time, an update doesnt break things	0
last time this happened thouhg, i didnt have any internet because a dkms module wouldnt compile because the kernel removed a header it needed	0
luckily some smart guy deleted the only line that used that header in a fork	0
i wonder if it affects things somehow, i mean, that line was there for a reason	0
everything worked fine since then so idk	0
yay -S downgrade && downgrade steam	0
its an aur package	0

but yeah things broke	0
things break	0
the python transition's are a work time to me	0
only update when you are ready for it	0
i update randomly throghout the day, i feel very satisfied and i get my shot of dopamine when i see everything up to date	0
masochist 	0
it simply does not work	0
what doesn't work	0
fucking steam	0
i am trying to stream ksp from my server	0
and the streaming client keeps crashing	0
funny thing is, yesterday it worked fine	0
today i got a steam update	0
on arch	0
but not on ubuntu	0
and streaming is fucked now	0
oh doesn't steam update by itself btw	0
i guess i have to wait to get the update there as well?	0
not on my arch	0
its a package	0
i guess i have no clue	0
also downgrading the steam package seems to do absolutely nothing	0
after downgrading, steam reports the same version	0
even after reboot	0
yes because i think steam self updates	0
the arch package is a launcher	0
....	0
steam manages itself	0
you should get the same upgrade on both machien btw	0
this is retarded	0
let me check one more time	0
fuck, its the same version	0
so the update on arch broke stuff	0
funny thing is streaming works just fine from my laptop to my server	0
but not the other way around	0
i think i am reinstalling steam	0
if this doesnt work, tough luck	0
i think you are screwed	0
you have to actually why exactly it doesn't stream	0
launch steam from terminal on both ends	0
yep, doesnt work	0
look for error messages	0

Broadcast message from mattf@rehoboam (pts/5) (Tue Dec 21 15:55:16 2021):	0
flu why so much stress?	0
also, to answer your question	0
in romania, the price for kwH of gas has become too fucking expensive, and it will get much more expensive in the next year, so i am using the server to heat my apartment	0
oh really?	0
but it doesnt make enough heat	0
this will be a great experiment	0
oh	0
how much more heat do you need	0
so i hit it with an artifical load	0
right	0
I have something that can generate an artificial load	0
well not really artificial 	0
because it will do real work	0
but it should be easy to connect it in such a way that you can dial in a wattage	0
well, not really sure, my electric radiator is something like 2700 W, while the server power supply can take a maximum of 490W, so it isnt that much heat compared to the radiator	0
2700 okay	0
so if you have something like a cheap PC power supply rated at 400 W	0
well, it's an artifical work load, because it doesnt do anything useful, it's just a stress utility that makes procs go to 10%	0
if you had 10 of those	0
that would be 4000	0
then running them at 50% would be 2000	0
something like that, yeah	0
but	0
I think you wouldn't want to max out a power supply	0
keep in mind that you have to take into account the efficiency of a power supply	0
shouldn't it be 100% efficient?	0
where else is there for the energy to go	0
let me explain it someway else	0
when it says on the ps that it can output 100	0
if it doesn't produce heat at the supply it will produce it at the motherboard or somewhere else	0
W for example	0
right	0
but it has an efficiency of 10	0
it means that its actually using 1000W	0
right?	0
okay?	0
and those 1000W used are transformed into 100 because of 10% efficiency	0
100W is just what the rest of the computer receives	0
oh sure	0
but if the goal is to produce heat, then you are basically transforming 100% of the energy you use as heat	0
so even if it's not computationally efficient	0
it is 100% efficient as a heater	0
that means that if the whole computer is used to the max, it would consume 1000W + 100W that is transformed to heat	0
thats true	0
yes, a computer is always 100% efficient as a heater	0
100 W is what it consumes, both converted to heat and actual cpu usage	0
but the PS is not 100% efficient as a transformer from AC to DC	0
no	0
wait no, there isn't 100W of heat being generated	0
if you are taking in 100W worth of energy then won't you eventually get 100W of heat?	0
if the computer consumes 100W, yes, there is almost 100W of heat being produced	0
even though it might be close	0
i dont take into account mechanical energy for drives or fans or RGB	0
those drives would also produce heat	0
oh i used the wall command orangeFlu 	0
to some degree, yeah	0
but not all of it	0
shouldn't the total amount of heat produced be almost exactly the same as the electricity consumed?	0
where else would the energy go?	0
yes	0
except for random radiation particles that fly out the window	0
exactly	0
magnetic fields and mechanical for the fans, drives or light for any RGB or monitor	0
infrared	0
but those are not that high	0
mattf: heat is infrared	0
no	0
infrared means you are wasting your heat away	0
yes	0
you just defined hear	0
heat	0
heat is particles vibrating	0
that can generate infrared	0
and infrared can be later converted to particles viration again	0
there is no case in which the particles vibrate and they dont radiate that through infrared	0
unless you are in a greenhouse you are leaking that infrared	0
they are the same thing	0
all particles vibrate all the time though	0
and hence they all emit light as a result	0
our objects emit infrared	0
the sun emits normal light and uv	0
every object emits infrared?	0
even an electron?	0
yes	0
not necesarrily infrared	0
but yeah	0
acceleration of charged particles generate electromagnetic waves[	0
a neutron wouldn't emit nothing	0
this is something I never understood very well, the relationship between heat and infrared	0
and it doesn't have to be infrared	0
I think I understand now	0
an electron goes up a level of energy from some excitation, and when it goes down, it emits a photon with the wavelength equal to the energy difference between those levels	0
thats when it receives a foton on a atom orbital	0
thats how reflection works	0
this phenomenon is the cause of a lot of things	0
like phosforence	0
how do you spell that	0
phosphoresfence	0
Phosphorescence 	0
maybe	0
the light from phosphorus is always green because the difference level between the orbital that determines this effect is equal to a green photon	0
which is also the reason you can charge a phosphorus object with light with lower energy than green	0
it doesnt have the energy to kick the electrons up 	0
charge with red, it wont glow	0
What is an electron	0
charge with anything more than green: blue, violet, uv, it absorbs it	0
particle or wave?	0

i feel alive	0
I like to introduce my "bug" in a lady.....	0
thats not... uhhh....	0
that sounds like a nice job, orangeFlu 	0
:)	0
never say that again :)	0
I migrated our entire project to a new server over the weekend	0
crash the server, troy	0
and I handed everything over	0
Then sleep	0
Hi handyc	0
hanb	0
I will be done with my contract after this week	0
hi loudercake 	0
they didnt appreciate you	0
loudercake do you know what an electron is	0
crash their server	0
no they didn't appreciate me at all	0
no I will not crash their server it is not right to do that	0
i would leave a backdoor for myself	0
but thats me	0
i told you what an electron is, did you see it?	0
Handyc kinda	0
Its like	0
A particle of an atom?	0
yess	0
good job	0
funny thing is, it doesnt have to be attached to an atom	0
plasma (or fire) is just electrons floating freely	0
together with hot atoms	0
but they are separated	0
I left a backdoor and told them I left it	0
why do you ask physics questions and then leave and dont respond :))	0
what is the maximum length of an electron	0
I have heard that electrons can actually extend for 3 miles or more	0
i dont know that off the top of my head	0
i dont think they can extend, i think they are pretty fixed	0
oh really	0
seeing as they are not really a particle	0
I will try to find the document I readf	0
it was online	0
maybe it said something else, i am pretty sure they can't extend	0
maybe it was like a trick involving special relativity	0
like it seems to you that its extensing	0
s/extensing/extending	0
like it seems to you that its extending	0
no I think this was classical	0
classical what	0
newtonian?	0
classic physics not special relativity	0
special relativity is considered classic these days	0
newtonian I guess	0
well I am not sure	0
I will try to find the document	0
ok, dont come back without it	0
did i tell you i did research on super lasers in a lab in my university	0
in the times i went to uni	0
sounds awesome	0
it was	0

it was awesome	0

I have access to a 20 node supercomputer right now	0
but they will probably cut me off in a couple weeks	0
damn	0
i still have access to that supercomputer	0
nice	0
but it is too weak	0
I am trying to find something similar that I can keep working on	0
this one is tied to my job, contract ends Dec 31	0
want my login?	0
i will give it to you, i dont care	0
I could definitely make use of it but don't you think that is risky?	0
no	0
i will drop out	0
okay, then I would really appreciate that!	0
this uni treated me with such disrespect and stuff	0
i couldnt give less of a flying fuck	0
universities are like that	0
I have dealt with many of them	0
i'm not sure you would get the tools you need	0
I have been in the university system for more of my life than I haven't	0
romanian universities are something else, believe me	0
oh?	0
I have had to deal with universities in 3 countries now	0
i have worked my ass, proved i was a good student, even won some awards, did physics research (kinda, not published)	0
but a proffesor didnt like me	0
and she told her husband	0
well, you are still young	0
and they keep failing me on their subjects	0
there is plenty of time to build of a list of many professors who don't like you	0
and i cant keep doing it	0
that is when you know you have really achieved good scholarship	0
build *up	0
that sucks, man	0
i am sick of taking the same subject every year, i will drop off	0
and go to a university abroad	0
i have the skills, the english, everything i need	0
i lose a few years, sure	0
but i will get a better education	0
i will try to get into a denmark uni next year	0
maybe denmark, we will see	0
i need to get my TOEFL or Cambridge until then 	0
well, let me search for the login stuff for the supercomputer	0

orangeFlu: That sounds cool	0
I would yeah	0
i'm working now on making a satellite constellation for kerbin	0
the math of it is pretty simple	0
but the rocket i am using is less than stellar and unpredictable	0
plus, i just found out the payload i was using was made by someone less than smart and put very useless stuff on it	0
which in turn made my rocket very very nose heavy	0
it may have to do with the unpredactibility	0
i dont why i am using stock rockets and satellites when i always used to make my own and they always turned out fine	0
i am a mean rocket designer	0
so, i'm thinking something like 1 plane with 4 satellites as a start, 0 eccentricity	0
6 satellites would be easier to calculate, but anyway	0
no, sorry, the eccentricity is 1, the inclination would be 0	0
and then 1 more plane that goes over the poles, with 4 more satellites	0
since kerbin has a siderreal day of 6 hours, it means i should launch a rocket every 6/4 hours	0
.wa 6 hours divided by 4	0
(orangeFlu) Result: 1.5 hours - https://is.gd/ImzhcJ	0
so every 90 minutes i launch a new satellite	0
that or every 7h30	0
because i dont think there is enough time to launch a satellite and position it in 90 min	0
you catch my drift?	0
what is going on with handyc's rpi	0
oh sorry	0
i think he's sick	0
bad connection	0
by the way, does anyone know if it matters that the satellites are not in a synchronious orbit?	0
i'm guessing not	0
but maybe it messes with my math	0
handyc: have you ever played?	0
played kerbel?	0
no	0
does it not attract you?	0

I don't have much free time I can spend on those things	0

gasconheart: Now I can't tell if you are still being sacarstic	0
ok	0
listen	0
let me just solemnly swear I am not being sarcastic	0
Ok	0
there is not much more I can do	0
Well man idk	0
Does it happen on openbox?	0
you have certainly the right to interrupt a conversation, and I will always respect that, but it would certainly be a pitty if it is over a misunderstanding	0
oh	0
I only tested it on xfce	0
Maybe this keyboard sends something that is really a shutdown signal and the bios will just do the rest of the work then	0
So you can't remap that key	0
hm	0
ok	0
but	0
If it doesn't turn off on openbox, check what is the key code and name on xev	0
anyway, how can I find out what process, or application, is 'reading' that particular multimedia key from the keyboard?	0
sure, that I know how to do	0
I think there isn't quite a way	0
ok	0
That's some xorg thing	0
Idk if xorg can list that somehow	0
Start easy and make that test	0
ok	0
I have some wireless keyboards	0
which are very convenient	0
Openbox or something that comes with literally nothing like twm	0
If it also turns off give up	0
I see	0
The power button is simply doing what it is designed to do	0
I never heard about that being done over USB though. So yeah test it	0
I also have an infrared 'remote control', with like 20 keys or something: the numbers, the main multimedia keys, esc, enter, home, end, space, and a few more	0
Well just use a phone	0
Kde connect	0
It's pretty cool	0
Works without kde and outside	0
I'm an XFCE person now, no kde here anymore (I even uninstalled it!)	0
Over wifi	0
I use the smartphone sometimes	0
with termux, ssh and pulsemixer, it is fantastic	0
It is usable	0
My phone is 6 years old	0
more than that!	0
And i have custom ROM Android 10 on it	0
more than usable	0
mattf: but it is not the poweroff button I am talking about; it is one of the multimedia keys, there is one to power off the machine, other to suspend it, and even one to "wake up" the computer	0
I am not talking about the key that powers off the computer through BIOS	0
Interestinf	0
Well first make sure there is really something listening to that on OS level	0
it is a regular key, in the same line with the volume keys, the mute key, the "mail" key, the "www" key, it has a moon as its icon	0
there is	0
it worked perfectly on KDE	0
which I uninstalled	0
I uninstalled KDE	0
I see	0
and it works also on, sigh, Windows	0
You surely didn't have enough remaining disk space	0
remaining disk space? hm?	0
Nothing proves this is t actually being captured by the bios	0
correct	0
it may be being captured by some other process or app	0
it happened to the volume keys and the mute key	0
they had been being captured by xfce4-volumed.... so no matter how I remapped those keys, it was being ignored and overridden all the time	0
I killed and uninstalled xfce4-volumed and boom! now I can use the mute and the volume keys	0
so, that key, which until yesterday was working on KDE, and that still works on, sigh, Windows, does not work in XFCE for some reason	0
I use the XFCE utility to assing a command to it, and it gets ignores, perhaps overriden by some other process	0
idk	0
Why would it be the same with that power key	0
Make the test and be sure goddamit	0
I don't know why that should be the same with that power key	0
how could I test it? ....	0
anyway, I thought there might be a known process that captures those multimedia key presses; I thought perhaps that is identifiable or maybe even identified, if it is a known processes that does that	0

Ok what happened	0
donut finale is out	0
mattf why you don't like rap music	0
why most old people dont like rap music?	0
well that's complex	0
because it sucks!	0
joke	0
most people like the music that was popular when they were 17 years old	0
hmmm	0
i think music is dying	0
no	0
but what you said is a factor	0
but still music is dying	0
people say that all the time	0
music became a product	0
that you have to sell	0
because anyone can produce music these days	0
people said the same thing about reading 2000 years ago	0
before internet and literally anyone being able to present music to everyone in the world	0
before computers	0
before deezer, spotify, soundclou	0
you had to do something really different to get attention	0
and it was hard to make music	0

handyc: did you go watch matrix	0
no I could not leave the house	0
handyc: how could you not like dune btw	0
have you heard about it	0
it is the best of this year so far	0
mattf have you seen the other dune movies	0
you know star wars was based on that book	0
pink floyd was going to do the soundtrack the first time they were going to make that movie but it was cancelled... this is before star wars even came	0
dune: story is great, new movie is bad	0
why is it bad	0
I like the earlier dune movie with sting	0
i didn't watch it	0
what bothers you about the new one	0
well you can watch and compare	0
bad storytelling	0
how many minutes did you watch	0
12	0
the movie starts at 40	0
or so	0
then it sucks	0
that is indeed, i agree the beginning is weird	0
 it is the part 1 of a series of movies with more than 2 hours handyc	0
movies don't start in the middle	0
I don't need to watch a movie for 30 minutes to get to the beginning	0
what i mean is it is only later that you will understand what is actually going on	0
that's called a bad movie	0
the introduction is necessary!	0
nah idk, maybe could be different indeed	0
man	0
but after finishing it i dont think the story telling was bad, but yeah it is a long begining	0
I study literature	0
ever heard that pink floyd song	0
idk many of them	0
I know most	0
they only start like after 5 minutes	0
long introductions!	0
no	0
mattf	0
in one sentence	0
what is dune about	0
i never watched the old or read the book but we are just analyzing the part one of this new movie series	0
mattf	0
in one sentece	0
yes	0
what is the new dune movie about	0
it is about	0
surviving and betrayal 	0
 	0
mattf let's start a boom club with loudercake 	0

Never read dune	0
Talk about what?	0
loudercake do you like books	0
yes i just dont know what to read	0
loudercake what do you like to know	0
dune is not a bad movie	0
the new dune	0
you can't judge any movie without watching it all	0
Idk handyc	0
I did watch it	0
loudercake: did you watch dune?	0
handyc: it all	0
No	0
where is orangeFlu to help me	0
dune yeah	0
im not saying it is one of the best movies ever, but at least worth to watch, better than the average worth to watch movie	0
Gtg	0
when I was loudercake's age	0
thats where i would put it	0
star wars was out!	0
I was introduced to the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs	0
tarzan?	0
yeah	0
that was one of them	0
but he wrote another couple series	0
oh that john carter movie	0
one was where these people go to the core of Earth	0
is based on smt byt this guy	0
and they fight dinosaurs	0
oh yes	0
and the other is John Carter of Mars	0
what is that genre called	0
adventure?	0
that is actually a really cool series 	0
fantasy?	0
scify?	0
all of them?	0
the new movie by Disney is dumb	0
sci-fi fantasy	0
handyc: always when someone watches the movie about a book they read they will say it is bad	0
thats why i dont read books	0
:P	0
lord of the rings would be called something like high fantasy	0
ha	0
books are always the best	0
high fantasy, high as in drugs	0
have you read lord of the rings	0
it's awesome	0
no	0
oh man	0
read it	0
it's so good	0
im too stupid for literature 	0
no not high as in drugs	0
high like high on the plataeu	0
thats what they say	0
high fantasy is like D&D	0
knights in shining armor	0
all movies are dumb handyc	0
no	0
you have 2 hours to present things	0
mattf, that's nihilistic	0
have you seen 2001	0
you end up with all expositive dialogs and that sort of shit	0
handyc: only the first 5 minutes	0
HAH	0
2001 is one of the best movies of all time	0
handyc: too bad story telling	0
nothign happens for the first 10 minutes, just a monkey throwing a bone up	0
ha ha 	0
yes	0
YES!	0
it's true	0
well here is my other all time favorite movie	0
apocalypse now	0
ooh the one with the meme	0
no no	0
i heard about this one	0
that it is good	0
yes watch it	0
it's an amazing film	0

hahahah new = stupid	0
incredible film	0
watch the director's cut	0
movies are dying right handyc	0
yeah	0
I know	0
every small company can do a movie nowadays	0
it is no longer rare or creative	0
yeah but they suck	0
do you know why	0
(like what i just said about music)	0
because literature is dying	0
yes	0
CGI is easy, storytelling is not	0
YES	0
that is true	0
thats the truth about movies	0
well CGI is not easy 	0
it's easier than telling a story	0
but looks impress people more and you dont have to think  too much	0
people might not even understand a really good story	0
but it takes only one person to write a good story while for a good CGI scene it takes a team of 30 people and a millions worth render farm full of expensive gpus	0
but watching giant robots fight sell more than good plot ideas right?	0
indeed	0
we could make one	0
yeah! most people can	0
if they want	0

is that wrong?	0
no	0
everybody does	0
I am not used at all with the "RON" accronym	0
ok	0
what else would you call it?	0
people call it "RON" lately	0
ah, RON i only use in formal conversations	0
so very rarely	0
or when talking to foreigners	0
oh	0
gasconheart: i dont know anybody that says that	0
my wife's relatives do	0
on sites and such, prices are called RON, yeah, because thats the standard way to refer to it	0
they do? jesus	0
sometimes	0
i will see a lot of relatives tomorrow, i am going to listen and see 	0
interesting	0

oh it is so annoying	0
i hate xmas	0
gleen for those expressions for me, will you	0
I hate xmas too!!	0
hey mattf 	0
last time I went to Brazil I paid with "cruzeiros"	0
gleen? what expressions	0
there is barely anyone i talk with online, IRL i have absolutely nobody i can talk with	0
did you ever use "cruzeiros"? mattf 	0
yes	0
didn't use	0
i heard about and seen it	0
what is that	0
old currency	0
I am more Brazilian than you are, mattf 	0
"old"! hahahaha	0
there was a period brazil was changing currency every year	0
I used cruzeiros when I traveled to Brazil in the 80s	0
thats not old?	0
it is 	0
no no	0
ok it is a new  currency	0
very much so	0
of course NOT :)	0
reais is the future currency	0
what the fuck are you even talking about?	0

oh I thought we closed the office	0

good bye ROL	0
let me go back there	0
"ROL"? those I don't know	0
you left mattf locked in the office?	0
rolas	0
ROL was the currency before RON	0
the ROmanian Leu	0
what does the N stand for anyway??	0
have you not wondered why is it called RON now?	0
the N in RON	0
I have!	0
exactly	0
"leu nou"	0
pffff	0
in 2006 i believe they decided 1000 lei will become 1 leu	0
Uruguay has changed from "peso" to "nuevo peso" then to "peso uruguayo"	0
and the new leu was called RON	0
yes, countries do that to cut off zeros and somehow offset inflation	0
yes	0
it should have been called RONL	0
whatever	0
never wondered why people still say "am dat un milion pe aia"	0
I grew up in the era of the "nuevo peso"	0
instead of "o suta"	0
that is clear, orangeFlu 	0
you cant call it RONL	0
same thing happened in the 80s in Uruguay	0
the ISO standard says it should have 3 letters	0
"un millón de pesos" = "mil nuevos pesos" in the 80s	0
i forget exactly what standard	0

is it weird that i am wondering how your voice sounds, mattf ?	0
it just hit me that i have no idea	0
i imagine it very deep	0
do you remember the chemical reason why salt makes water boils ehm	0
make it require more temperature, raises the ebullition temperature	0
it does, the temperature needs to be greater for it to boil	0
yes why	0
it's treated like an impurity, all impurities raise the boiling temperature and lower the freezing 	0
this is not why 	0
i remember knowing why that	0
i forgot so much	0
well, i didnt give you a reason	0
i dont remember	0
i need to look it up	0
oh its boiling point in english damn	0
if i wasn't doing 5 times at the same time	0
ok a somewhat better answer from google. When table salt is added to water, the resulting solution has a higher boiling point than the water did by itself. The ions form an attraction with the solvent particles that prevents the water molecules from going into the gas phase. Therefore, the saltwater solution will not boil at 100o	0
yeah ions break apart when the solve in the water, Na+ and Cl- 	0
water intermolecular forces are hydrogen bounds, which are one of the strongest i think	0
apparently the ions in salt attract molecules. Na attracts the oxygen molecules, while Cl attracts the hydrogen in water, and they are held by statically electrical charge, and the molecules are heavier	0
so more energy is needed to separate them	0
and make them gaseous	0
yes that makes sense	0
that would make one think that then it is easier to freeze the water, but thats not true	0
so it raises the melting point	0
so either this explanation is nonsense or it is half the story	0
doesn't it make it easier to freeze if it raises the meltind point?	0
or does it not	0
oh water has that weird hexagon forming property	0
salt might bother that a bit	0
its a higher ceiling of energy for them to becomes solid	0
salt actually lowers the meltind point!	0
but thats not the case	0
well, yeah	0
my guess is because it is preventing water to form chrystals	0
melting point equals freezing point, no?	0
that could be the case	0
Adding salt (or any foreign substance) to the water upsets the delicate balance between freezing and melting. Fewer water molecules reach the surface of the ice in a given time, so water freezes more slowly. The melting rate isn't changed by the salt, so melting "wins" .	0
kinda makes sense but feels meh	0
Salt water freezes more slowly than pure water because many of the water molecules that would be “crashing” into the surface of the ice in pure water are replaced by these salt ions.	0
so does this	0
kind of the same thing	0
it feels unsatisfying	0
yep	0
to me too	0
but it makes sense it is just kinda... meh	0
of an answer	0
it comes into what i said earlier about impurities, but idk	0

eletronic like jarre, vangelis, kraftwerk	0
rock, metal like iron maiden, metallica, power metal like dragonforce, angra	0
and progressive rock like pink floyd	0
i really like melody	0
i like music that can give me an eargasm	0
i dont like music that i already like after listening once	0
процедура	0
i love kraftwerk!	0
unfortunately, i dont know bands that do music like they did, except for oxygen maybe, from that french guy	0
jacques something	0
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxyg%C3%A8ne	0
Title: Oxygène - Wikipedia	0
ah, you said jarre	0
nvm then	0
you know it	0
yeah this guy has a lot	0
i like industrial revolution	0
and oxygen 1 2 3	0
i love длб	0
but i know almost all from him	0
and ZAPRAVKA	0
i dont like rap or whatever that might be	0
electro, edm, a bit on the hardbass and rap side at times	0
yes the new eletronic	0
oh draft punk	0
its like edm but with lyrics as if it were rap	0
i like it, not like i enjoy jarre but it is nice	0
daft punk	0

sharp s	0
yeah ss	0

・ ​ ゜゜・。。・゜゜\_​0< quac​k!	0
just to be a hot girl	0
surely yes	0
i only ocasionally watch it for her	0
ok now she sings	0
not really, she sings really well	0
this is all fake autotuned singing of course but who cares	0
i dont	0
i think the guys sing much much better	0
they have different styles though	0
oh yes and i hate songs with less than 4 minutes	0
:P	0
Romanov is slow rap, Teo is the fast flow guy and she is hot and mediocre	0
well at least 3 min	0
mediocre at singing	0
also, i just love that on Teo's shirt it says PIZDA	0
unironically i want a tshirt like that	0
maybe not pink	0
i hate young people in general	0
interesting	0

but thats the only one that stuck with me	0
from who knows how mnay years ago	0
but in general, i dont like rock now	0
DAMN	0
although i did use to listen to it about 15 years ago	0
oh yes	0
ok, not 15, 12 years ago	0
when i was discovering music	0
because my dad liked rock	0
stepdad	0

moldavianFlu: oh i watched dune btw	0

well time to finish donut	0
yes	0
do it	0
hi man	0
olteanFlu: feeling like trash today as well	0
you know, man	0
let me tell you a story	0
i have a whiteboard in my room	0
well, not in my room per say	0
it's actually at my parent's, in my old room	0
i never took it with me because honestly i dont know where to hang it	0
what i am trying to say is that whenever i feel bad about myself, i have a routine to go through	0
and it happens to me all the time as well	0
I would consider myself as a semi-confident person	0
but i do doubt myself a whole lot	0
so what i like to do is set up a few goals, simple goals	0
and a schedule to keep track of my goals and so I don't derail and waste time	0
so things like: i will wake up at 9 am, and make my bed. Making your bed is a very simple task that you could start your day with and it makes you feel just a little bit better	0
then something like "i will take a shower	0
"	0
and go up in complexity, ending the day with a "after work, maybe i will work on my game a little bit, or read that book i've been having for a while but cant find the time to read although i know i do have the time and i am just making up excuses"	0
or maybe you have a project that you want to work on, or something new you want to learn	0
at the end of the day, look at what you've accomplished	0
and you will feel much better	0
the next day, do the same and so on	0
you will start feeling less and less like trash, i promise you	0
the thing with the whiteboard is that i usually put my tasks on it, but now i dont have it, so it is just a google keep note	0
but i forgot to mention that	0
and maybe i need to read a book or watch a tutorial about telling stories, cause i am obviously not very good at it	0
olteanFlu: thats some monologue	0
ill have to invoke emacs speedread	0
olteanFlu: I do pretty much the same on emacs org :P	0
difference being i am never able to finish what i planned	0
and i go to sleep sad thinking of myself as a failure	0
some days i dont even do nothing	0
hey olteanFlu thanks for sharing your thoughts with us	0
I can't use a whiteboard for that, because that would put pressure on me	0
I keep those personal notes in my mind instead	0
I also try to keep track of what I accomplish, then compare what goals I've attained and such	0
ok, in 30 minutes I'll be on the road!	0
good morning mattf 	0
hi gasconheart 	0

orangeFlu: it takes 30 seconds to render a frame at 30 C and at 100 C it takes 3 min on my machine	0
what are you on about?	0
thats your computer's fault	0
there is another factor at play	0
if i had a better cooling system wouldn't i have better performance?	0
no	0
of course not	0
what kind of jackassery is this	0
are you fucking on the weed?	0
explain	0
explain, what	0
you said temperature affects performance, i say it doesnt	0
explain why when it is hotter it is slower	0
you have the burden of proof	0
it is not getting slower because the temps are high?	0
and the cpu clock freq is reduced	0
prove to me that it is the temperature directly affecting the performance and we can talk	0
what?	0
until then, this is lunacy from the moon	0
moon talk	0
conspiracy theory to sell better cooling systems	0
interesting	0
did you ever play a game on a mobile	0
So asus and corsair make more money	0
mattf: of course i did	0
if it is a heavy game, doesn't it drop more frames, becomes more jagged when the phone is hotter?	0

orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 2.948 seconds! You have made friends with 52 ducks in #romanian.	0
(mattf) There is no duck! What are you shooting at?	0
maybe? isn't the only way a phone can reduce the overheat by reducing the cpu clock to keep it on the safe limits?	0
i'm not qualified to asses that	0
me neither :P	0
but again, i do think that this is only perpetuated so that big cooler can sell expensive coolers	0
but im tired of renders that start super fast and then get slower and slower	0
saying it offers performance	0
wait, i am qualified	0
i am an electrical engineer	0
oops	0
or computer engineer, more accurately	0
it doesn't offer performance, it avoids you loosing performance 	0
nevermind, i have decided you are right	0
lol	0
temperatures do affect cpu performance	0
of course they do	0
it is what i always though because im so used with it	0
who in their fucking right mind would say they dont	0
my computer at 90C, even after the process is killed, it takes a while until it is back to normal	0
it can be only temperature	0
of course	0
the hotter the cpu, the slower it runs	0
if you run your computer without fan it wont overheat until the bios emergency shut it down	0
it will become a fucking slow machine on the slower clock it can to keep it safe	0
that doesnt really happen anymore	0
what doesnt happen	0
the bios emergency shutdown	0
the bios emergency shutdown?	0
thats last resort	0
i already had it	0
on an old laptop	0
it most often bluescreens or whatever	0
on newer computers	0
if that fails, the bios steps in	0
well but the point is, temperature will limit overall performance	0
yes, obviously	0
im not crazy right?	0
no	0
ok 2 guy agree with me and that guy doesn't	0
i thought it was obvious i was messing with you	0
3x1	0
again, computer engineer	0
i know too much about hardware for my own good	0
how many guys must disagree with one so you can call him insane	0
there is no such threshold	0
:P	0
It will run at the same speeds until it dies  [23:27]	0
an old cpu doesnt run any slower as time goes	0
this is fucking bullshit	0
if you have a super dooper cooling system you can then overclock to the moon and how would that not be a performance gain 	0
silicon does degrade from higher temperatures over a long period of time	0
it is not directly a performance gain just because of the temp, yeah ofc, what i mean is that you can achieve it	0
shut up	0
what did he mean by that?	0
yeah that sounds like bs	0
well, it is	0
buy a gpu used by a miner	0
benchmark it	0
against the same model new	0
yeah	0
you will see much of a difference	0
no	0
yes	0
oh maybe	0
silicond degrades	0
at startup they might be the same	0
for the same reason phones do become slower with time	0
but the older might get hot faster	0
they dont have active cooling	0
it gets hotter more often	0
therefore the silicon degrades	0
now if you keep them on the same super dooper cooling that doesn't let them heat up ever then i guess will be the same?	0
in theory, but you cant	0
never will	0
there will be defects in the silicon from manufacturing that will add up to the tear of the silicon	0
let's say your silicon is always on 0 degrees kelvin or close it	0
then at that point, yeah, you could theoretically run them at bery high frequencies without degradation	0
is that possible? no	0
the problem is that you reach a point where you cant remove the heat from the silicon faster than it gets produced	0
what i think is those things have this dynamic clocking that besides other things receive temperature as an input and will reduce the max allowed frequency depending on the temperature. Is that right? 	0
basically the reason frequencies havent gotten better in a while	0
yes	0
they are even smarter than that	0
but sure	0
so if you fool this sensor and tell both gpus they are at -100 C  will perform equally until they explode?	0
will they*	0
they will throttle themselves based on package temperature	0
mattf: no	0
increased heat in the silicon also means that sometimes electron will flow when they shouldnt	0
electrons	0
which generates errors	0
it happens much more often that you might think	0
oh, and those things are constantly correcting that	0
makes sense	0
but there mechanism to correct for those	0
so the older will have that much more	0
and perform worst	0
makes sense	0
even if the cpu doesnt limit itself, it will still receive much more of those errors than usual, and accounting for those slows it down	0
yeah i get it	0
cool	0
well anyway, if you can keep it colder it will perform better	0
and this guy said no	0
he is a bit hysterical, many times i would agree with what he said and he would say no to that then	0
cool thing is modern processors can actually detect which cores can have the highest frequencies on temperature - some will come with some minor deffect or something making it harder to readch higher frequencies	0
you mean per core temperature monitoring	0
?	0
say, idk, a powerline in the silicon is narrower than it should be	0
from a manufacturing defect	0
ah 	0
not everyhting is perfect	0
interesting	0
nothing is	0
so it will heat more and consume more power because it has bigger resistance	0
what you mean is smt like, it is accounting that on this core it has to perform more error corrections so lets use it less	0
say that taht affects one core in particular	0
well, then, that core wont be favored when choosing what cores to boost	0
and how much to boost it	0
smart	0
humans are insane smart arent them	0
leave the error correcting stuff for now	0
that was another discussions	0
now i am talking solely about defects in the silicon wafer	0
in the die itself	0
which differs from proc to proc	0
you mean just the overheating due to bigger resistance like on a thinner trail 	0
and how they account for that	0
yeah	0
that core won't be chosen to boost that much, while the core next to him might be close to perfect, so it gets boosted to 5 ghz instead of the normal 4.8	0
because it can be and is more efficient	0
i get it	0
so it contributes less to the total heat output	0
that was a revelation for me	0
its fascinating indeed	0
it seemed so fucking smart at the time	0
it still does, actually	0
the level this stuff is nowadays is insane	0
all the shit they must do to keep procs improving	0
speculative branching? that shit is insanely smart	0
or speculative execution	0
transistors are almost of atoms nowadays	0
yeah	0
.wa size of a processor transistor	0
(mattf) No results.	0

intel has anywhere from 10 to 14 these days	0

i actually wanted to know the smallest they made	0
amd clains litography is 7nm, not sure if it is exactly that	0
smallest i know is 4nm	0
4!	0
how is that shit made	0
but you get into a lot of problems there	0
electrons flowing randomly through closed transistors	0
quantum tunneling 	0
exactly	0
didnt know if you knew about it	0
that is basically what is happening	0
man i was learning how to solve schordinger's equations when i was 15	0
its propietary technology, there are probably not many details online	0
mattf: sure	0
you know how braggy that sounds, right?	0
not really, first it was a waste of time	0
because i forgot 90%	0
and i wont ever use that on my life	0
because i dont even have enough social skills to get a job or talk with someone properly	0
even if you knew how to do it, you probably didnt understand how it works, because who the fuck understand partial differential equations at 15	0
oh that i did and i might still do	0
you knew how to derivate and integrate?	0
oh yeah that i surely still do 	0
and did	0
so do i	0
but at 15?	0
you have no idea how weird i was at that age	0
i studied math for fun	0
so did i, but i was much more into algebra then, no idea what calculus was all about until 17	0
i never liked literature or anything, and i didnt like computers back on that day, but i liked math and physics books	0
damn, i liked physics as well	0
15 to 17 is almost the same :P	0
looking back now	0
not to the level i was actually that good	0
but i enjoyed it	0
i like to think i am not smart	0
im not either	0
i feel pretty dumb	0
but i work hard to get to the level where people think i am	0
and that is worth much more to it	0
i wasn't able to keep all i learned	0
willingness to work	0
and improve	0
im always forgetting everything	0
the only thing i remember is that those things exist and how hard they are	0
give me your skype or whatever	0
i want to talk to you	0
or discord	0
I remember studying about this simplest problem you can solve with schrodinger's equation, what was it? the confined particle on a squared potential? like width w and constant and then goes to infinte on both sides	0
you mean the potential well?	0
and the the wave function is a sin or something like e^{i*theta}}	0
which is the same kinda	0
point is, it is a periodic function	0
sin is not e^{i*theta}	0
it is not what i mean	0
e{	0
e^{i theta} = cos(theta) + i sin(theta) 	0
oh	0
that is quite important for electrical engineering, phasors	0
yes	0
thats basically how they invented phasors 	0
i kinda remember those	0
not much	0
i had those in uni too but dont remember much iehter	0
either	0
i havent used anything from my analog engineering classes in a long while	0
only digital	0
it is everything i care for	0
I wanted to understand general relativity at that time	0
tensors, Christopher symbols, covariance	0
tensors, mate	0
i think i will never be on that level again	0
i was really interested in lasers and electromagnetical waves, maxwell and the likes	0
me neither	0
i wish i did\	0
i wish i didnt bail on thaty physics project with my proffesor	0
with all those cool lasers	0
we were fucking melting metal with lasers	0
and i bailed	0
not enough time	0
do you remember taking the 4 maxwell equations and fooling some algebra around until you get a wave equation and thus that is the eletromagnatical wave, with a velocity of 1/sqrt(ue) or something	0
this was a insane day to me	0
yeeeeah	0
i do	0
because this was when i realized how you can find real world things just fooling with pure math	0
1/sqrt of electrical and magentical  permittivity of space	0

if you don't find her, you call her on the phone	0
if you can't call, you can send an email	0
if you need free wi-fi, there is usually free wi-fi at train stations and cafés	0
i see	0
that could be pretty screwed up	0
・゜ ​ ゜・。。・゜゜\​_ó< FLAP FLA​P!	0
.bef	0
handyc you befriended a duck in 10.678 seconds! You have made friends with 119 ducks in #romanian.	0
well, as long as you have a device that can use wi-fi, you should be fine	0
the train system in Germany is very good	0
yeah but dont forget i am feral	0
when are you doing this?	0
no idea	0
my wife keeps talking about going back to Spain	0
ho why	0
we could all go to Spain together	0
as a trip?	0
indeed!	0
to eat sardines	0
yes	0
you go by train	0
we went there for 2 weeks last time	0
or plane	0
we flew from NL to Barcelona	0
is it possible to travel the entire europe by train	0
then we walked around in Barcelona for a while and then we took a train to Valencia	0
yes, you can do it	0
there is even a special pass for students	0
you can get a special eurorail pass	0
not just for students	0
I am not sure how it works,  I never got one	0
no idea and im not a student	0
When we went to Barcelona we stayed in an AirBnB	0
yeah I know you are not a student	0
being a student on a scholarship would be a way to stay long term though	0
i dont want to stay very long	0
this first trip no more than 3 at max 4 weeks	0
Yeah, that makes sense	0
It can be exhausting to travel	0
You can stay here as long as you like	0
We have a spare room	0
how far are you from tina	0
how far are you from grounau	0
3 hours to munster by train	0
4 hours to gronau	0
4? oh weird	0
it should be closer	0
I'm on the west side of NL	0
I have to cross all of NL to get to Germany	0
oh 	0
is see	0
but she is in the westernmost part of Germany	0
she is nearly in NL	0
at least she is on the west side of germany and and NL is pretty small	0
so we can visit you	0
i can't promise the same to gascon	0
yeah	0
it took us a while to get to gascon's house	0
we flew in to Barcelona and then we had to take a train for an entire day	0
and then he farted on all the pillows	0
but he was a gracious host and we felt welcome	0
i don't have any doubt he is	0
it would be dfficult to make that trip and also Germany, though	0
unless you flew in to Germany, and then you and Tina both went west to NL and then to Spain	0
and then you flew out from Spain	0
or the other option is this,	0
you fly in at Spain and go to gascon's house,	0
then you and gascon come to my house,	0
・ ​ ゜゜・。。・゜゜\_O​< QUA​CK!	0
then the three of us go to Germany to Tina's house	0
so it will be like a possee	0
posse	0
lol wth	0
.bang	0
mattf you shot a duck in 16.406 seconds! You have killed 355 ducks in #romanian.	0
and we will all dress up in matching oufits	0
then she will be really impressed	0
mattf, once you are in the Schengen Zone, travel is very easy	0
it's just a matter of time andmoney	0
time is easy money.....	0
but otherwise there's no passport control or anything once you are in Europe	0
s/money/, money/	0
time is easy , money.....	0
yeah mattf, that city is actually almost exactly east of me	0
I would just have to travel straight east for 4 hours	0
schengen?	0
no, gronau	0
oh yes	0
well i need to learn and get used with flying	0
but that requires more money than i have	0
well, just get a job here and you will have plenty of experience in no time	0
handyc: I am getting pessimist about getting a job	0
why?	0
im not really qualified	0
I understand	0
I will try to see what's up with my boss	0
you should be optimistic, mattf	0
opportunities are everywhere	0
idk	0
im kinda getting trapped on a routine i dont really do nothing	0
because of the pandemic?	0
no, because im stupid	0
you are brilliant, mattf 	0
you just need a plan	0
well idk	0
i wasn't able to build a portifolio yet	0
mattf you have imposter syndrome	0
but you will do fine	0
why is everything a syndrome 	0
i am just stupid and introvert	0
not everything is a syndrome	0
but it's common to get imposter syndrome	0
mattf I am an introvert too	0
I understand	0
but you aren't stupid	0
at least socially stupid	0
well, you can learn to be socially graceful	0
that's something people learn	0
nobody is born with good manners	0
mattf, the nice thing about the Netherlands is that everyone here has poor social skills	0
so probably no one would even notice	0
there's a town in the Netherlands right across from Gronau	0
you could get a job there	0
haha idk, this people dont want foreigners to take their place	0
enschede	0
no mattf, they don't care	0
because everyone here is a socialist	0
they get paid no matter what they do	0
even if people become homeless here they still get paid	0
looks dangerous	0
there's nothing dangerous about this country	0
this is the most boring country in Europe	0
handyc: my plan was building a nice portifolio but i think I failed	0
why do you say so, mattf?	0
you do have a nice portfolio	0
it takes time to build a portfolio	0
mattf, growth is a process, not an event	0
handyc: i dont have any good project yet, i have ok projects	0
all of us have okay projects, mattf	0
mattf, the way to cross the room is to cross half the room	0
 indeed but getting someone to pick you and pay you, when there are so many people righting for this same place	0
im not saying i have to become a complete failure, maybe i could be my own boss	0
well mattf, those inteviews can be difficult, yesa	0
yes	0
I did a few interviews already as you know	0
yeah 	0
I think once you get an established record, though, people will start calling you	0
it's getting your foot in the door that is the challenge	0
yeah	0
・ ​ ゜゜・。。・゜゜\​_O< qua​ck!	0
.bef	0
handyc you befriended a duck in 233.818 seconds! You have made friends with 120 ducks in #romanian.	0
.bag	0
mattf what was that	0
what	0
.bag ?	0
you are losing your touch	0
233 seconds, for shame	0
yeah	0
i dont want more ducks tonight	0
handyc: did you decide what will you do meanwhile	0
mattf I guess I will take some freelance jobs for a couple months	0
we just got this company approved and I'd like to try out just being a freelancer for a little while	0
then I will get more serious about finding a "real" job	0
there are many software dev jobs around here	0
I think I can get something, even if it is not very fun	0
handyc: oh so you plan to freelance as for the company	0
yeah	0
cool	0
the company was just a way to stay legal	0
but if I can grow it into something larger, that would be interesting	0
yes indeed	0
It would be nice to have a small software company with maybe 5 employees	0
very	0
or not even employees, just a team of people working on projects	0
you just need to find a godo client	0
what do you mean?	0
a client that is willing to pay for a company to develop his software and it is big	0
yeah	0
im considering doing apps and maybe little games like we talked about	0
the problem with custom software is that the kind of people who would hire someone to make software for them massively underestimate every part of the process	0
mattf I will go to bed pretty soon	0
oh ok	0
it's 2 am	0
but we should talk about these things again	0
don't despair, mattf	0
i dont	0
we will keep working on things	0
eventually we will get a million dollars	0
thanks	0
yeah we should do a game	0
game(s)	0
that is a different market though	0
yeah it is	0
my wife gets a lot of jobs for translating Chinese games to English markets	0
your wife is so smart	0
there are a lot of small companies in China making really shitty mobile games	0
yes she is a genius too in her own way	0
yes indeed	0
she has a good business sense	0
tina is so stupid, she doesn't do nothing	0
How does she earn money?	0
she doesn't	0
just on work placements	0
Well, everybody has their own way of doing things	0
yes	0
she wanted to join a university 	0
I think if I were in a typical 9-5 job I would die	0
but it is too hard	0
What does she want to do?	0
I mean what did she want to do at the university?	0
anything on health i guess, from doctor to veterinarian 	0
well that can be very hard	0
yeah	0
I have heard that being a veterinarian can be even more difficult than being a human doctor because you have to know multiple animals	0
that was something I wanted to be when I was a kid	0
I am glad I did not do it	0
yeah my parents wanted me to be too	0
I would not want to be responsible for someone's animal dying	0
it's a good occupation if you are good at it and like animals	0
yeah 	0
when I was in high school I thought it would be fun to be a surgeon	0
I liked doing dissections in high school bio	0
if it was like doctor house	0
doctor mouse	0
well the horrible things about being a doctor are, for one thing, you could get called out to some emergency at any hour of the day or night	0
yeah	0
and then you might have to be awake for 36 hours at a time	0
and then if you fuck it up, someone might sue you for 10 million dollars	0
and if you do well, you get rich but then your marriage is probably messed up from your surgeon lifestyle and she divorces you	0
haha	0
typical	0
some of them do okay, though	0
okay I will get some sleep now, goodnight	0
・゜ ​ ゜・。。・゜゜\_O​< QUA​CK!	0
.bang	0
mattf you shot a duck in 133.114 seconds! You have killed 356 ducks in #romanian.	0
Valencia is the Land of Oranges	0
mattf: do come and visit, guy	0
right behind the mountains I see from the hotel window is France	0
hello france	0
I will take a walk now	0
yeah	0
I'm still in Spain	0
I am literally at walking distance from France	0
all it would take is for me to climb a steep mountain	0
I am at climbing distance from France	0
・ ​ ゜゜・。。・゜゜\​_O< FLAP FL​AP!	0
Hi guys	0
gasconheart: You will never get to the france	0
Or whatever that song says	0
loudercake: wheres yer donut	0
i will build spotify inside emacs today but using org mode links	0
hi	0
hi handyc 	0
gasconheart says you have to go to his house	0
handyc: creepy	0
Spain is better than France	0
handyc: what does better mean	0
better place to live, better place to visit	0
France sucks	0
they are a nasty people	0
stinky people? 	0
handyc: how often do you shower	0
I shower two times a day	0
sometimes more if I feel cold	0
oh !	0
and how often europeans in general shower	0
is it true that it is common to do it once per week	0
I don't take general showers, I only take specific instances of showering	0
mattf, I am not sure about the habits of other Europeans	0
and I'm sure it varies by country	0
and what do you know	0
but probably most of western europe has fallen victim to late 20th century hygiene advertising	0
so I think most people here probably bathe regularly using a wide variety of soap products	0
hah interesting	0
certainly the stores sell all kinds of things, so someone must be buying them	0
so europeans do shower regurlaly	0
I would imagine for most people a daily routine would include showering and applying underarm deodorant	0
Yes, I think so	0
nice	0
maybe orangeFlu can weigh in with his own experiences	0
how about you, ken?	0
handyc: I'm not 	0
ken do you still bathe in sewage?	0
handyc: I don't understand 	0
ken you know what I mean	0
handyc: Yes I know what you mean 	0
orangeFlu? loudercake ? gasconheart ?	0
fgs is gone btw	0
and elp	0
loudercake doesn't even know Brazilian manners	0
yeah	0
mattf: hellooooo	0
gasconheart: hi	0
I sent you some audio clips!!!	0
oh ill look	0
hey, share my videos and audio clips with loudercake 	0
loudercake: do you have telegram?	0
how?	0
he is anonymous	0
mattf will give you my telegram so you can add me, loudercake 	0
oooh	0
idk	0
i mean i dont really have him on telegram or anywhere else	0
wasnt it you who brought him here?	0
hahaaaa gasconheart 	0
i just heard it	0
i just listened to it	0
and replied	0
im turning emacs into my media player!	0
well technically a playlist manager	0
mpv is the player	0
+ org mode + evil mode it is a vi like playlist manager 	0
+ youtube-dl and it supports local and youtube uri's	0

handyc ^	0
that's cool	0
I start my new anonradio show on Jan 6	0
awesome	0
chinese music again?	0
no	0
something different this time	0
it is more like a thought experiment	0
to get at the meaning of meaning	0
How is meaning transmitted in language will be the ongoing theme	0
you will talk about philosophy? 	0
I am not exactly sure what I will do	0
I will try to keep it entertaining	0
so no plans?	0
I do have plans	0
I said I am not exactly sure	0
but I do know what I will do	0
i see	0
I am going to try and have my wife on sometimes	0
oh that's going to be interesting	0
yeah I think so	0
she has some interesting ideas	0
people seem to find her funny, too	0
i also really love this prog/jazz band called camel	0
i have a song reserved to play when i get a job	0
finally got LSP + linting to work wonderfully on emacs	0
good morning	0
mattf: can't you download the images, audio and video clips I send you to Telegram? If you can, you can put them in a /gasconmedia folder at my Arch Pi, so that loudercake and the others can check them	0
handyc only watched the first 10 min of dune	0
dune sucks	0
i dont think we can change his mind	0
look at that	0
but	0
best movie of 2021	0
no matter how much he is wrong and i want to punch him	0
he is entitled to his opinion	0
thank you	0
ridiculous	0
I will watch it again	0
Here is my question	0
what is spicd	0
spice	0
what is the spice	0
my log only goes back to nov 6, but we already knew each other then	0
spice is a psychoactive substance	0
yes	0
tell more	0
I have taken acid	0
that was used by people to navigate the stars	0
because it was giving them visions of the future	0
it was indispensable	0
・゜゜・。 ​ 。・゜゜\_O<​ FLA​P FLAP!	0
and very fucking expensive	0
.bef	0
orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 2.619 seconds! You have made friends with 59 ducks in #romanian.	0
.bef	0
(handyc) You tried befriending a non-existent duck. That's freaking creepy.	0
.bang	0
(mattf) There is no duck! What are you shooting at?	0
it sounds like acid	0
because it was only found on Arrakis	0
but the Fremen were using it because it was sacred for them	0
so thats how you write that	0
so yeah, without spice, it made interstellar travel very dangerous	0
so it was very important and everybody wanted it	0
mattf: write what?	0
orangeFlu did you ever take acid	0
fremen, arrakis	0
handyc: i did not	0
very hard to find here	0
yeah	0
man do it	0
if you ever can	0
why	0
it will change your life	0
lol	0
Bun venit, mib_ppte4u, în serverul IRC al lui Gasconheart! Fii răbdător, curând o să vină cineva să vorbească cu tine. 	0
just one more test	0
ok	0
what about alcohol?	0
handyc is our drugs hippie	0
yes	0
happy new year, folks	0
la multi ani orangeFlu 	0
alcohol changed my life, weed not so much	0
mib_ppte4u: what is it you are trying to do man	0
I have taken many drugs	0
this is gasconheart 	0
I'm going to bed	0

mib_ppte4u: la multi ani, omule, sa traiesti, fi fericit si sanatos	0
acid changed my life	0
oh my	0
did you inhale? :)	0
yes	0
acid?	0
no	0
nice	0
i dont think you inhale acid	0
bye	0
bye	0
I did it on a sugar cube	0
it's a liquid	0
i thought it was those little stamps you put on your tongue	0
it can be	0
it's a liquid	0
vroooom	0
you can put it on anything	0
this was on sugarcubes	0
there are 5 states of matter: plasma, gas, solid, stamp and liquid	0
yeah	0
this was a liquid	0
the more you know	0
cool	0
right	0
i will be sure to try, if the opportunity arises	0
it is not very stable	0
i am not stable	0
what about bose-einstein 	0
I wish I could gift it to you	0
mattf: i dont think it's really confirmed it's a valid matter, and really, what constitutes a matter state is very arbitrary	0
it changed my life	0
yeah but it exists	0
 	0
handyc: keep that in your mind for when i come in march	0
yes	0
orangeFlu 	0
I can get you weed but not LSD	0
i have weed	0
weed is easy	0
LSD we would have to make	0
i dont like it, but if i did, i know many people that sell	0
handyc: what?	0
I like it	0
how do you make lsd	0
in a lab	0
do you have a lab that could make lsd?	0
no	0
i would have been impressed	0
okay	0
idk, it seems dangerous from what i've heard	0
i never want to try cocaine	0
dangerous to make or do	0
that i am sure of	0
to do	0
no	0
physically not dangerous	0
i dont want to do cocaine, math, crack	0
I did coke	0
i have coke right now	0
but not cocaine	0
I don't like it	0
;)	0
no I mean cocaine	0
i know	0
I did it, I do not like it	0
i am not stable mentally	0
not at all	0
did you ever talk to me?	0
I know	0
auch	0
i will snap at any incovenience 	0
but you are more stable than you imagine	0
i sing in russian	0
okay	0
i like to talk to myself and i have mood swings	0
orangeFlu you are my friend and I care about you	0
why	0
because you are my friend	0
why am i your friend	0
it's written on the wind	0
maybe you are the unstable one	0
hmmm	0
you shouldn't write things on the wind	0
could be	0
what does that mean?	0
it will easilly get carried over	0
ask gasconheart 	0
he is not here anymore	0
what wind	0
why not?	0
what wind?	0
orangeFlu why are you sad	0
because i spent my new year's alone and i wasnt invited anywhere	0
i know why	0
you are here	0
i just wish the last two years never happened	0
you are not alone	0
everyone wishes this	0
never mind the covid	0

he said yeah, but you will disappear again for a few months	0
and it made me really sad	0
you can come to my house	0
we will feed you eggs	0
you can sleep in a bed	0
that does sound a bit creepy, idk if you do it intentionally	0
then it will be real	0
i will have a bed, dont worry	0
bring the bed?	0
no, i have accomodation	0
that is more creepy	0
my bed is already there, i just havent paid for it yet	0

oh nice orangeFlu 	0
180 fps is pretty insane	0
i had vsync on	0
it severed my fps	0
idk why	0
vsync i think it's nvidia, right?	0
huh? doesn't that stand for vertical sync	0
yeah	0
or, shit	0
that was gsync actually	0
that was nvidia	0
freesync is amd	0
isn't that basically telling it to keep a constant framerate	0
it gets so fucking confusing sometimes	0
to sync it with the referesh rate of the monitor	0
but idk how well it works on linux	0
or if the monitor needs to support it	0
idk and idc	0
it works without	0
40 GiB: estimated download time: 9 hours	0
wtf	0
it started now, i will tell you when it is done	0
what is that	0
when is ksp2 out	0
witcher 3	0
42 gigs	0
downloading now	0
steam thinks it will take 9 hours	0
i beg to differ	0
oh i have it	0
me too in a few minutes	0
i usually buy a game, play 5 min and never open it again	0
i dont	0
i usually play it a lot	0
if i like it	0
i stopped liking any game	0
but i usually dont like games like witcher	0
rpg like games?	0
idk, if thats what they are called, sure	0
like god of war	0
it has rpg elements	0
final fantasy	0
even more	0
but maybe thats not what you dislike	0
i never played those	0
maybe you like the movie like games	0
have no intention to	0
nah	0
or you dont like 	0
like the last of us	0
i like games that make you think	0
it is a single direction movie that you play	0
i ocasionally like a good story in a game	0
meh	0
i see	0
do you like the old resident evils	0
no idea	0
let me guess, you are a pc gamer since always	0
never had a console if thats what you are asking	0
yeah	0
well, actually, i had a PSP	0
but never emulated either	0
i loved that little thing	0
no	0
did you play gta5 btw	0
yesss	0
that i loved	0
ok good	0
so much fun	0
yeah	0
i kinda want it again	0
i have it	0
i never played it with more than 15 fps	0
i am able to play on linux	0
thats fine, i will buy it	0
if it works on linux	0
and it does apparently	0
it definetly does	0
with nvidia	0
not sure about amd but might work	0
i dont think it makes a difference these days	0
well idk, it used to	0
yeah	0
but since vulkan and the likes	0
they are kinda agnostic	0
i played it like 2 years ago or more on linux	0
proton has come a long way since then	0
i cant wait for the steam deck	0
i will for sure change it to arch	0
maybe	0
it will be like my tablet	0
that i never had	0
i will finally be able to ssh into my machines	0
and do crazy stuff	0
cant wait	0
witcher is done	0
from the steam deck? :P	0
it will have steamos	0
which is based on arch	0
so yes	0
40 gigs in like 5 minutes?	0
good	0
steamos, wasn't the first steamos for the steam machines based on debian	0
it could be faster	0
i remember that :P	0
orangeFlu: thats insane enough	0
SteamOS is the primary operating system for the Steam Machine gaming platform and Steam Deck hybrid video game console by Valve. ... It runs SteamOS 3.0, which is based on the Arch Linux distribution with a KDE Plasma 5 desktop, rather than the Debian base used for earlier versions of SteamOS.	0
yeah that is today	0
brb, going to witcher	0
if you read the second paragraph of that wikipedia page it is telling about debian :P	0
i saw	0
and?	0
it is on arch now	0
you were right	0
i had that on a machine	0
and i am right	0
we both win	0
i thought you went game	0
i have this on my other screen	0
but i will not pay attention it so much	0
ocasionally	0
ok	0
fuck	0
it doesnt launch	0
meh	0
get glorious egroll	0
fuck	0
fuck	0
fuck	0
fuck	0
maybe reboot	0
it has to work	0
found the problem	0
vulkan doesnt work	0
fucking hell	0
thats why witcher doesnt start	0
cs go and ksp do	0
because they dont use vulkan	0
vulkaninfo output: ERROR: Incompatible compiler options cross compiler instances!ERROR at Success	0
i worked it out.........	0
uninstall amdvlk package	0
how can the official amd package suck worse than its opensource mesa equivalent	0
anyway, fixed, fuck that shit	0
orangeFlu: glad to hear	0
・ ​ ゜゜・。。・゜゜\_​ó< qu​ack!	0
the proprietary amd driver doesn't support vulkan, is that it?	0
wait but sounds more like you had to uninstall vulkan...	0
.bang	0
mattf you shot a duck in 47.838 seconds! You have killed 370 ducks in #romanian.	0
i will reduce my time to sleep from 4 am to 3 am	0
slow progress	0
no, it does support vulkan	0
jsut that its buggy	0
apparently it doesnt support all of it	0
its not fully compliant	0
what is funny is that the other version, from mesa	0
is fully compliant	0
yet steam gives me a warning that it isnt and should only be used for testing	0
from what i've read on the internet, it's the other way around	0
funny that	0
i am going to sleep	0
good night and happy new year	0
mattf: are you here mate	0
hi	0
almost leaving	0
okay'	0
did you see my last messages?	0
what happened some days ago	0
from a few days ago	0
you came as root	0
yes	0
:P	0
emergency	0
i fucked up big time	0
mode	0
???????  ??\_?< FLAP FLAP!	0
what was it	0
.bang	0
mattf you shot a duck in 2.741 seconds! You have killed 375 ducks in #romanian.	0
in short	0
pacman -R sway zsh bash	0
it was not a good time	0
oh really	0
why	0
oh	0
-R...	0
why you did that :P	0
i actually cant remember, but i stayed up all night	0
i mean, all i remember is that i used ansible to make some config	0
for sway	0
and i didnt like it	0
and couldnt find a way to make it go away	0
oh man	0
cause some things ansible did i really couldnt understand	0
but why would you remove bash	0
so in my sleep derived brain, this was supposed to fix everything	0
I DONT KNOW	0
you were high or something	0
I WISH I DID	0
no, but had beers and no sleep	0
i once removed bash in slackware	0
and it took me a while to fix it	0
it was my only shell	0
but i had a browser open and a terminal i kept open so i was able to download the binary for bash and put it in /usr/bin and it worked	0
luckily, i still had the flash drive with arch, so arch-chrooted like 10 times, weird errors were coming up and so on	0
but i fixed it	0
you shoudln't have turned off then 	0
but those adventures are funny	0
and swore never to uninstall my shell	0
funny thing is	0
yeah	0
root was on zsh as well	0
and effectively i had no bash shell, so even if i did install bash, there was no user to use it	0
but that is easily fixed	0
from now on, root stays on bash	0
i made many bad decisions	0
yeah i always leave root with bash	0
but removing shells is very weird	0
no idea what you were thinking	0
:P	0
in other news though, i realised that my screen wasnt actually functioning at 300Hz	0
as it should have been	0
thats probably true	0
instead it was at 60	0
cause wayland decided so	0
but i played around with the sway config and manually specified 300Hz	0
and everything is so fucking smooth	0
oh you can see that when you drag a window around	0
like you wouldnt believe	0
well, i cant really	0
tiling window manager	0
but still, when scrolling the browser and stuff	0
you can make it float	0
jessssuuuuus	0
oh yeah	0
i never do that though	0
kinda defeats the purpose	0
you sound like gasconheart now	0
i like my windows autotiling	0
what about those small popup dialogs	0
well, i got sway for a reason, otherwise i would have gone to kde or smth	0
well, those float, not much i can do about them	0
but i dont move them	0
yes those	0
as soon as i am done with them, close	0
same	0
i hate them cause they destroy the look	0
so i try to finish my business with them fast	0
:P	0
i got this really cool app	0
wdisplays	0
sounds like wayland only	0
that lets me adjust the positions and stuff of screens	0
whats that for	0
positions, resolution, refresh rate	0
ah you are using that laptop on multiple screens?	0
yeah	0
cool	0
works beautifully	0
wayland doesnt have a single problem for me	0
which begs the question	0
well wayland is definitely the future, but im still not ready for it	0
why arent more people using it?	0
seriously, what is holding you back?	0
i am not because there are a few things that doesn't work there	0
warpd	0
i havent used a single app that doesnt work	0
even electron apps dont complain	0
what is warpd	0
well electron wouldnt	0
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/warpd-git/	0
Title: AUR (en) - warpd-git	0
electron is notorious for being fussy on wayland	0
does firefox work	0
and nvidia wont work	0
i play a bit with blender every single day	0
firefox works fine	0
chromium works fine	0
optix is nvidia only and is the only way i can render things fast	0
I made an anime girl today	0
and the config is really fucking easy to modify, easier than i3 and x and picom, cause they are in the same place 	0
no need for 4 different configs	0
and this https://i.imgur.com/426mISQ.jpg	0
does emacs work fine on wayland	0
everything from shortcuts to transparency to mouse/touchpad input and keybindings	0
everything is in the sway config	0
yes, it does	0
well I will eventually switch to wayland when nvidia works	0
i use it everyday for modifying stuff, works fine	0
guess i will have to write warpd in python or so	0
https://i.imgur.com/hGXXabo.jpg	0
what do you use warpd for? i couldnt understand from the github repo what it does exactly	0
damn	0
such a weeb	0
what	0
you are such a weeb	0
but in a good way	0
what is a weeb	0
a geek that also likes anime and stuff	0
oh	0
i se	0
i just like animes	0
but you are a geek	0
orangeFlu: warpd is baiscally vim for Xorg	0
:P	0
but thats quite an exaggeration 	0
when im lazy to use the mouse i can use the keyboard	0
shortcuts for using your pointer with your keyboard?	0
the fuck	0
it has this hints mode, it fills the screen with two letter hins	0
then i can put my cursor close to anything	0
and adjust with vi keys	0
but it is fully configurable, the shortcuts	0
and how is that useful? aside from the unlikely case in which the mouse is broken and you dont have another	0
sometimes i just want to "click the damn link" and not to touch a mouse	0
why	0
i dont want to touch a mouse	0
this, i cannot understand	0
is not that i dont ever want	0
sure, sometimes its nice not touching the mouse	0
but in a browser, why wouldnt you do it	0
but i i have to touch my mouse just to click a damn link and then come back to the keyvboard it is  annoying	0
i dont use a mouse at all on my browser	0
literally anything other than games and browser, i only use the keyboard	0
im talking about links somewhere else	0
i have vimium on my browser	0
it is all vi like, i got hints for all clickable things	0
you know	0
since i met you	0
if i am on blender, or editing video, images, or just very lazy i am using the mouse	0
i started to hate the expression "vi like" with passion	0
if i am coding the whole day and chatting, then i dont want to touch it	0
well by "vi like" I usually mean just motion with "hjkl"	0
i can kinda understand	0
i dont want everything to be modal	0
i know what you mean, i just hate it	0
what i really like is driven by keyboard	0
you should start using vi	0
you know why i really hate the mouse	0
i will never	0
why	0
my right indicator finger is in pain	0
on the keyboard i can use another fingers for the same thing	0
i used a mouse a lot and played keyboard a lot forcing that finger	0
it was the best so i just overused	0
i guess that makes sense	0
so i keep trying to find ways to at least let it heal, but then i just kept getting used and used with this and now 	0
it is like this now	0
so, when you do start using wayland, i will give you my config'	0
i have many comments 	0
i want to use qtile on wayland...	0
so you know what to modify	0
oh	0
traitor	0
it was a lot of work on this qtile	0
i even patched it	0
what about compositors on wayland	0
how does it work	0
picom?	0
well, compositors arent really a thing	0
it works?	0
no	0
they arent a thing	0
so you can't have blur? transparency?	0
the application that builds the graphical interface is basically the compositor	0
ah thats better actually	0
did you read what i said before?	0
some things	0
i had a whole monologue about a single config'	0
i might have read and forgotten	0
basically, if you want transparency for alacritty for example	0
its 4 am 	0
you can do 2 things	0
you tell allacrity to be transparent on its yaml	0
yes	0
and it works	0
or you select it with sway based on class name/id	0
isn't there really a compositor	0
kind of the same way you do with picom	0
i guess wayland is the compositor	0
sway is called a compositor, but it doesnt mean the same thing it means in X	0
yes makes sense	0
no, wayland is the server	0
it is a window compositor :P	0
sway is the compositor	0
really?	0
what is the window manager	0
still sway	0
thats why i said	0
oh thats is worst then	0
compositor doesnt mean the same thing it does in x	0
its not	0
because everything is in one place	0
and you can be sure	0
that if you install sway or another window manager	0
everything in one place isn't always good	0
transparency and other fancy shit will just wrk	0
no need for separate application, worry about compatibility	0
but i want gaussian blur that only has on that fork of that fork of picom	0
thats an advantage	0
in this case, i think it is, because it is homogenous	0
letting the user mess things around	0
the more decoupling the more messing around	0
and i like messing around	0
well, sure, decoupling is good	0
yeah one thing i s messing around and another thing is just working	0
but it creates a lot of problems in X	0
gotta admit	0
it does	0
idk, i will wait more for wayland and pipewire	0
maybe they can come separately	0
but sway doesnt	0
yes i was thinking that	0
pipewire, likewise, hasnt done me any problems at all	0
smooth as butter	0
the only thing that makes me pull my hair out: the wi-fi card	0
i dont have a second monitor, i have a second lapdop. I use pulseaudio built in rtp server to have the audio fromt here	0
the wifi card?	0
linux still has problems with wifi on 2022?	0
if i reboot my computer, it doesnt work. i have to shutdown, wait for a few minutes with no ac adapter plugged in and then it works	0
oh thats really weird	0
maybe because it's still new	0
hahaha 	0
i sometimes have to restart NetworkManager	0
randomly it stops, i restart and it works	0
interesting	0
maybe you could try that next time	0
for me it works fine	0
systemctl restart NetworkManager	0
the driver is the problem	0
i tried, obviously	0
one of the first things i tried	0
not stupid, you know	0
maybe you can unload and load the driver again, those mod commands	0
but it didnt even show up as an interface	0
ah	0
well	0
man i have to sleep	0
this is afaik the only way to make it work	0
ok	0
i need to get to work	0
its 9 am	0
good night	0
???  ??????\_?< QUACK!	0
.bef	0
orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 41.320 seconds! You have made friends with 60 ducks in #romanian.	0
orangeFlu: good night. maybe come earlier next time we could talk more :P	0
always nice talking with you	0
see ya	0
sure, buddy	0
apparently the "sway" philosophy is that blur shouldnt be a part of sway	0
fuck me	0
yes	0
hello	0
hello	0
handyc?	0
???  ??????\_?< FLAP FLAP!	0
.bef	0
orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 4.715 seconds! You have made friends with 61 ducks in #romanian.	0
hi orangeFlu 	0
nice to see you	0
nice to see your text to	0
sorry I was so weird the other day	0
I got pretty drunk for NYE	0
what	0
what are you talking about?	0
ha ha	0
aaa	0
got it	0
new year's eve revelry	0
when you said you loved me?	0
no, I do love you	0
I think what creeped you out most was when I said we'd feed you eggs	0
I was just fooling around	0
but you can have eggs	0
i genuinely dont remember that :)))	0
ha, okay	0
you were probably pretty sauced up yourself	0
i remember you said something about tea'	0
yeah, i kinda was	0
I think you said the police came to your house or something	0
three beers and i was already pretty tipsy.... what happened to me...	0
the beers must be stronger over there	0
not really	0
3.5-5.5	0
depending on the beer	0
oh, that's pretty low actually	0
some of the ones here are 8 and 9	0
i mean, you can find 10 or so, but i dont buy that	0
yeah, it's barely drinkable at that point	0
i like to go a little bit lighter, just in case	0
yeah me too, usually I go for around 5	0
the police came to my house?	0
again, no idea	0
what the fuck did i do that night	0
I don't know, you said something like "just talked to the police"	0
but you seemed to be doing okay	0
you were working on reinstalling an OS or something	0
all i remember is you said you loved me, mattf was there, i was drinking and watching a romanian streamer and i fixed a few bugs in my configs	0
anyway, happy 2022	0
ha ha	0
well I do love you	0
thank you	0
but that is a little weird, I know	0
i love you too in my own way	0
happy 2022	0
yes, I know	0
You're a good person	0
let it better than that shitstorm that 2021 was	0
i wouldnt say that about myself	0
that's right, let's make this year better	0
You are too hard on yourself, that's why I said it	0
People need to hear that they are loved	0
a lifetime of observation has proven me that being hard on yourself makes you perform better and makes you depressed (1 in 3 chance)	0
i will take those odds	0
if i am not hard on myself, i will go lazy and lose myself	0
i have so many stuff i want to do	0
well, it's good to be hard on oneself in certain ways	0
it helps to get stuff done	0
but self hatred is not good	0
i need t begin writing them somewhere and just get to it already, the year already startd	0
there's a difference	0
i dont hate myself	0
i used to	0
a lot	0
but what happened was i met someone	0
as a scholar, to my mind, if I am satisfied with my work then I must be a poor scholar, so I am always dissatisfied to some degree with my work	0
but I don't hate myself for it	0
that's good, I'm glad you don't hate yourself	0
I think most people do hate themselves	0
a very toxic someone, but what she taught me was i am much better than i thought  i was, seeing how she is and how well she thought of herself	0
I know how those things are	0
it's good that you could get something good out of something bad	0
she imagined herself as this very good, well-behaved person with lofty ideals, but when you start dissecting those ideals, you realize they are empty	0
add that to the fact that she had major anger issues 	0
I know many people like that	0
and i saw the person i didnt want to be	0
and was happy that i didnt become that	0
My experience with people is that I usually have one or two close friends at a time	0
and at some unfortunate point things sometimes go sour	0
i never understood that	0
for me at least	0
i dont like fighting and getting angry	0
Which part, having a few friends or having a friendship go wrong?	0
good morning, fellows	0
sure, i get angry at my computer when something doesnt work out or whatever	0
but its not real anger	0
hey gasconheart 	0
nice to see you	0
having a friendship go wrong	0
hope you are still feeling okay	0
hi handyc 	0
hello gasconheart 	0
hello orangeFlu 	0
well, orangeFlu, most of my friendships as an adult have been through academia	0
classmates and such	0
and academics often have big egos	0
what i find is i pick my friends very very well, not to brag, but i dont fight with them. we have debates, they can get more heated sometimes, but not with anger. I never broke a friendship because of a fight, what happens usually is that we grow apart, and that's fine, we accept it and move on	0
yeah, they really do	0
i have met a few	0
It's great to have those kinds of friendships	0
those are rare for me but I do have a few	0
There is one guy I can always talk to that way	0
He entered the PhD program at the same time that I did	0
but he focuses on China and I focus on India	0
so we don't step on each other's toes	0
I argue with this guy all the time	0
We used to go to the campus bar and have huge arguments, but in a friendly way	0
what i'm trying to say is that not getting angry at people is kind of a superpower, if someone gets angry at me for whatever reason.. guess he/she wasnt a friend	0
One time we got into a really heated argument, still very friendly,	0
but other people watching us did not understand, they thought we were about to start throwing punches or something	0
handyc: i have one of those too, always arguing when drunk :))	0
when drunk and when sober	0
getting into philosphy or computers or politics	0
usually i dont catch my guy sober	0
almost never	0
This is one of my few friends I can say something like, "Well, you are just wrong"	0
and he won't get mad, he will ask why he is wrong	0
this is really healthy	0
and he does the same with me	0
yeah	0
very brilliant guy, one of the smartest people I've ever met	0
I keep trying to get him to come here, but he's not as good with computers	0
he doesn't understand IRC	0
my guy is a genius at math, i've been jealous of him for many many years, but damn, seeing the things he can do, he earned my respect 	0
oh	0
i wish he would	0
it's not that hard after all	0
just an older version of whatsapp	0
doesnt need to know more than that	0
ha	0
I used to get jealous of people like that	0
but now I just try to learn from them	0
you can do both	0
thats how i do it	0
yeah, I keep pushing my friend to come here, I think he is a little intimidated by software dev people	0
anyway, i'm waiting for an ambulance now	0
oh, are you okay?	0
he shouldnt be	0
no	0
I'm sorry	0
i may have covid	0
oh shit	0
did you know gasconheart has it?	0
dont worry, i am vaxxed	0
no, i did not	0
that's good at least	0
I got my booster yesterday morning	0
nice!	0
yeah, makes me feel a little better, still terrified every time I step out of the house	0
i have the sympotoms, but my tests have been negative so far	0
i mean those fast tests	0
that are not really accurate	0
i am waiting for them to make a PCR	0
and the whole ambulance needs to come	0
which is fine for me, i can wait	0
oh I see	0
but others cant really	0
yeah	0
i called yesterday for it	0
I ordered some tests through my school about a month ago, but I didn't use them yet	0
at 8 am today, they sid they will be here in half an hour	0
Jesus	0
yep	0
well I guess they must be pretty busy	0
they are swamped with orders	0
of course	0
because we as a people are dumb'	0
Well people in general are dumb	0
they are few and not well paid	0
maybe	0
This whole thing could have been over in 2020 if people had all just agreed to stay inside for a few weeks	0
but we on average are dumber	0
thats not really how it works	0
i used to say that too	0
Do you think it has to do with the political history of the country, or what?	0
but it wouldnt have wored	0
for sure, yes	0
I read this interesting article the other day about Elena Ceacescu	0
i actually dont know much about her	0
Ceaucescu	0
She was barely literate	0
that i know	0
but she wanted so badly to have recognition	0
so she got her husband to force a university to give her a PhD	0
i remember she used to tell people she was a chemist	0
They set up a fake defense	0
Yeah	0
She published tons of chemistry papers, all written by other people	0
They told people that her PhD thesis defense would be at 7:30 in the morning	0
and then people showed up to attend it and there was a sign on the door saying it had been moved to 6 in the morning and was already over	0
!!!	0
yeah :)))	0
and it never really happened at al	0
at all	0
very interesting	0
i didnt know so many details	0
there was an interesting thing i read in a book once	0
a communist book nonetheless	0
here is the article I read	0
https://paperpile.com/blog/elena-ceausescu-scientist-fraud/	0
Title: Elena Ceausescu: Greatest Scientist Ever -- except she was a fraud - Paperpile	0
about the subway, how it was built, etc	0
in bucharest, of course	0
yeah, I guess the subway station near the university had to be built in secret	0
Damn	0
you know it?	0
because she hated students and tried to prevent them from building a station there	0
this is just something mentioned in the article	0
So now apparently that station is very weirdly shaped	0
it wasnt the bucharest university, the economics university	0
because they had to lie and say it was some kind of maintenance building	0
so no the biggest, a shitty one	0
yeah, exactly	0
so basically, if you go there, it's narrow as fuck	0
and water is dripping on the walls	0
you cant really cme from the subway because you already get into the escalator	0
very poorly made	0
but it made me chuckle so much, cause i've been there	0
curiously, it had other stories about stations i never heard of	0
and you might say	0
so bizarre	0
well, they changed their name	0
i thought so too	0
I can't imagine wanting recognition for something I didn't do	0
but it was like "station A is being constructed between station B and C"	0
funny thing is	0
I knew station B and C, but there was no line between them	0
so what the fuck happened to A	0
where is it, and why was it connecting B and C when they aren't even on the same line	0
handyc: well, you have to understand that many people believed in the Ceausescus as almost gods, beings of infinite wisdom. That propaganda would be much easer spread if you can see, at least on paper, that they are smart people	0
hence the PhD and whatnot	0
did you see the video of them being executed?	0
it is on the internet somewhere, very bad quality, but i can find it	0
it's a video of the process and execution	0
the court process i mean	0
what is it called, i forget	0
anyway, it took 5 to 10 minutes for them to be condemned to execution by fire squad for crime against the romanian people	0
easiest process	0
apparently it is process, but it sounds wrong	0

It's better job with the external hard drive, right?  	0
ma gandesc de mult sa fac un aparat care sa tina multe CD-uri in el si sa citeasca ce trebuie din oricare din ele	0
Daca banii nu sunt o mare problema, da	0
hard-ul e mai bun	0
CD-uri sunt o solutie maide buget	0
unde mai pui ca poate sunt din alea de o data ce le scrii, nu le mai poti rescrie	0

Adica cei ca mine n ar intelege de ce "alearga" altii dupa "NOU".	0
That is what I would understand why "Running" others after "new".  	0

handyc you befriended a duck in 2.742 seconds! You have made friends with 127 ducks in #romanian.	0
My new project is working with some small OLED screens	0
I ordered cheap ones off aliexpress and they are just starting to arrive in the mail	0
One came yesterday, I still need to test it	0
but i only know a LED on the laptop gets orange when i'm low, and that's enough	0
why?	0
I have this idea for a smart keychain device	0
a smart USB stick	0
I bought a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller	0
i kinda want some as well, just not sure what do with it besides a poor man's tablet with a raspberry pi	0
It uses the Arduino language	0
and I want it to have a small screen so that I can check various aspects of its status	0
status as in...?	0
as in whether or not it's on, is it copying a file, is a button being pressed, anything	0
i need to go peepee, but i take my laptop with, go on	0
Teensy 4.1 has all kinds of digital and analog inputs	0
it's kind of like a cross between a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino device	0
much more powerful than an Arduino but not as powerful as a Pi	0
it doesn't really have an operating system, but it has quite a lot of memory and processing power for a microcontroller	0
You can hook up things like temperature sensors etc.	0
so any of those things I would do with it, I'd like a small screen just to give me a sense of what is going on	0
It can masquerade as a USB device and you can also plug USB devices into it	0
https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html	0
Title: Teensy(R) 4.1	0
but does it have the necesarry power to drive an oled?	0
yes	0
depends on the resolution, of course	0
i dont know what you got	0
these are very small screens,	0
128x64	0
ah, ok	0
very very small	0
and another is only 128x32	0
yeah	0
i actually wanted something bigger for myself	0
with a small font you can display four lines of text	0
but OLED has some unforgivable flaws	0
yeah, this is not to be used in place of a computer	0
for a keychain they are the best	0
small energy footprint, good colors	0
well they seem to be pretty sensitive, I think I broke one already by accident	0
these are monochrome screens	0
even better	0
most of the energy is lost converting to colors anyway	0
in modern OLEDs	0
like this:	0

Title: Monochrome 128x32 SPI OLED graphic display - Opencircuit	0
oh, i see	0

so cute	0
yeah, I bought that same one	0
it cost me about EUR15	0
but on Aliexpress they have some using the same chip for only EUR3	0
damn	0
so I ordered several of those just to compare the quality	0
how long did it take it to arrive?	0
i want some	0
only a few weeks	0
Aliexpress is usually pretty fast	0
i have a small board that i would be very happy to try to make it work with these	0
I got the SPI version	0
32k RAM, ARM M4 or something like that	0
SPI requires more wires but it is faster than the other option	0
yes, go for that refresh rate	0
yes	0
if you cant play doom on it, is it really a computer?	0
actually the Teensy 4.1 is powerful enough to run a DOS emulator	0
no, no it isnt	0
Yes it is	0
no no	0
that was in response to the doom thing	0
oh okay	0
Yes, agreed, Doom is the standard	0
i cant contradict you on that :))	0

Title: A Teensy 4.0 demo. Playing the old Stunt Island DOS game. Real time 3D.	0
the problem with mine is it's very hard to program it, you need to use pure C and it's hell	0
niceeeee	0
Teensy 4.0 is similar to the one I got, but the 4.1 also has a microSD card slot	0
uCs today are thecomputers from 20 years ago	0
I figured if I wanted to spend that much money on a microcontroller, I should go with the best one	0
yeah	0
how much money is it?	0
how much is it?	0
there is no need for "money" to be there	0
in America it's $27	0
I think it cost me maybe EUR30	0
and that's a lot?	0
my 32k ram thing costs more than that	0
or it used to	0
when it released	0
well, it depends on what you do with it	0
it's a lot if I want to buy 100 of them	0
I was imagining it was more for some reason	0
but I guess this is what I spent, let me check the NL site	0
well, this one has a 1500 page manual with all the fucking functions and registers and ways you can set it up	0
EUR 32,95	0
yeah, not bad	0
why do you want 100 of them?	0
oooo	0
make a cluster	0
make them execute stuff in parallel	0
they can "network boot" and get jobs to execute	0
well, I have had this idea for a long time to make Internet radio devices	0
not real radios but radio-like devices for streaming audio	0
like some kind of small box that looks like an alarm clock	0
i wager, if you could put maybe 20, you would make a decently sized processor	0
where would they stream from/to?	0
if I can get the price low enough I thought maybe I could do a Kickstarter and sell some	0
Internet radio sites	0
from radio sites?	0
yes	0
to headphones or something	0
i would assume	0
or speakers, yes	0
hmmm	0
I find old speakers in the trash all the time	0
I have a small collection of various speakers I've picked out of the trash	0
where does the connection come from? do they have wi-fi or lte?	0
Teensy 4.1 has an ethernet port	0
There are also some add-on boards to do wi-fi	0
it doesn't have the port, it has pins where you can install a port	0
https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html	0
Title: Teensy(R) 4.1	0
it has a kit that you can connect ethernet with, yeah'	0
i see that	0
they pack some punch for how small they are	0
i wonder something	0
yeah man	0
my first computer was a 286 with 640K of RAm	0
RAM	0
this one has 1MB of RAM	0
could it handle uncompressed audio?	0
like flac level of bitrate	0
I'm not sure	0
that would be pretty cool	0
hook them up to a good speaker	0
well, one thing I have been playing around with is this,	0
connect the Teensy to a Raspberrry Pi,	0
and use the analog ports on the Teensy for knob controls for the radio,	0
and then send those signals digitally to the Pi over the USB port	0
oh, you showed me that	0
yeah	0
so that one used a Teensy 2	0
isnt that the carton thing you made?	0
actually a counterfeit Teensy 2 from Aliexpress	0
yes	0
so this is the next version of that project	0
nice	0
cool	0
here's one of the goals,	0
I want a computer that can operate in any kind of environment,	0
so if I am in an ideal situation and have access to AC, the device will power up the Pi and everything and can be a small computer,	0
but if I am in a less than ideal situation and can only get a small amount of power from a solar panel or something,	0
the device could power up only the Teensy	0
sort of like those emergency radios that operate with a crank,	0
I was thinking, it would be great to have a computer like this that could adapt to any situation	0
i think i've seen those kinds of projects already'	0
yeah, well I am not the first to come up with this idea	0
yeah, it would	0
i want one as well	0
it's probably not something that will ever lead to me getting rich or something by selling it as a product	0
this is more something I am doing to teach myself about electronics	0
i mean, i would buy it, but i would rather make my own	0
right	0
most people who would see a use for such a device would probably feel the same way	0
so it's not very marketable	0
the only people interested in this stuff would be the people interested in making their own	0
because a person who didn't want to build one would not know how to use the finished one anyway	0
yeah	0
but that is also a nice challenge,	0
because I would like to make the device idiot proof,	0
i would put a very small version of linux, like void	0
something that feels exactly like a radio where you can switch it on and off easily without knowing anything about the underlying OS	0
damn, you have some nice ideas	0
ha ha	0
thank you	0
you got me interested	0
awesome	0
maybe you can help me improve it, then	0
hey, if you ever make one, i dont care how much it costs, as long as it is under 400 euros, i will buy it	0
ok, 500	0
no man, for you I would sell to you at cost	0
nah	0
you need to make money off it somehow	0
I don't want to make profit off friends	0
why not	0
well that's why I am buying multiple components instead of just enough to make one,	0
if I can streamline the process of making it and work out all the kinks, it should be easy to build at least one a day with minimal effort	0
there was a watch at some point, dont remember the name, something dumb, that you assembled and programmed yourself	0
i need to look that up	0
like a do it yourself Pebble?	0
it was out of stock last time looked it up	0
something like that	0
but less resurces	0
I saw something similar recently on Kickstarter or GoFundMe	0
i think you could get it to last a month or something	0
surely i have a bookmark somewhere	0

yeah they really pack a lot in	0
how does it have so many things in it	0
i am amazed	0
i cant even..	0
necessity is the mother of invention	0
with some 3d printed parts, this would make a great watch	0
and a strap, which you can get from anywhere anyway	0
yeah exactly	0
or a keychain	0
35 left of 900..... hmmmm	0
i would	0
I don't like having something strapped to my wrist	0
i do, very much so	0
I wore a wristwatch for years when I was a kid	0
but as some point I stopped	0
now I don't have any watch at all	0
I used to be really obsessive about knowing what time it was	0
then I learned that most of the time I do not need to know the exact time	0
i like to have it just because, plus, i can automate some stuff, like it would be very fucking cool to control the lights in my house from the watch	0
aside from the time	0
can you imagine?	0
it would be cool	0
but I wouldn't want to do that	0
but probably wifi would drain the battery pretty fast	0
why not?	0
well, I enjoy learning about technology and trying these kinds of things for the sake of a proof of concept,	0
but I also like my house to be "dumb"	0
there are so many problems that come with making everything in the house into a smart device	0
I don't want something like an electronic lock for my front door	0
I want to use a physical key	0
which is just as easy to break in	0
????  ?????\_0< quack!	0
.bef	0
(orangeFlu) Well this is awkward, the duck needs to think about it. You can try again in 7 seconds.	0
it's not so much about the security in that sense	0
.bef	0
handyc you befriended a duck in 7.743 seconds! You have made friends with 128 ducks in #romanian.	0
physical locks are so poorly made these days, i would rather trust a zigbee electronic lock	0
i wish i had the money	0
damn, if only i had more...	0
the problem with electronic locks and other things like that is that if the battery runs out, or the device is hacked or something	0
its always the damn money	0
and also, as a skilled user of tech, you might know how to use your smart appliances, but then if a guest comes to the house, that person could get very confused	0
well, think about how easy it is to "hack" a physical key, and then you will feel better	0
my guests can go fuck themselves, it's my house	0
ha	0
well not just guests, people like my wife	0
she's not tech savvy at all	0
so it would be more stuff for her to break	0
my wife can go ... wait no	0
she will learn	0
My wife even has trouble with appliances that are not smart	0
they all learn eventually	0
she is not technically inclined at all	0
no	0
she manages to break everything	0
also, one more thing i want to mention	0
off-topic	0
isnt it funny that i am browsing the web and watching videos and talking here	0
since 7 am	0
not one fan has started spinning in this time	0
yeah?	0
and it seems i still have some battery	0
and it's a monster of a gaming laptop	0
like it has the best amd processor for consumer laptops	0
what the fuck did they do with this laptop to perform so well?	0
I don't know, but I'd like advice about buying a new laptop	0
this one then	0
it looks funky, but damn	0
what is the brand?	0
it exceeded my expectations	0
ROG	0
Strix G15 Advantage Edition	0
again, it's a gaming laptop, not sure you need this gpu though	0
it may be too much	0
okay I found it	0
well I think a gaming laptop would be suitable for me	0
but then again, i dont know how much you actually game and what kind of games you like to play	0
I'd like to start trying to use the GPU for doing this text alignment stuff	0
ah, good then	0
well I haven't played any games for a really long time, but I would like to try some again	0
I still haven't played Skyrim	0
me neither	0
dont worry	0
i dont think we are missing out on much	0
The last game I got into really seriously was GTA San Andreas on my friend's Playstation 2	0
That was 10 years ago	0
no even more I guess	0
i tried witcher 3 some days ago, allegedly one of the best games ever made, got bored really really fast	0
when I was still working on my MA	0
i remember san andreas	0
jesus	0
gta V was the shit though for me	0
it was so much fucking fun	0
yeah, I get bored quickly with most games	0
GTA 5 looks great, I would like to try it	0
I don't think it will run on a Mac	0
but i never had a computer that could run that with more than 15 fps	0
i would try it now though	0
I am the kind of person who would be more invested in something like Dwarf Fortress than Witcher	0
I like a game with a good structure more than something with good graphics	0
One thing I have been thinking about for a long time, ever since I started working on religion,	0
is making a D&D type game that did religions in a less silly way	0
I am always disappointed with how religions work in these games	0
You just pray to a god and get spells	0
and there are different spells for different gods	0
but I have always wanted something a bit deeper	0
I had this idea for a game where you become a monk and get powers from doing things like meditating	0
In Indian religions, people get supernormal powers from advanced ascetic practices	0

waywarp	0
cool	0
let's do it then	0
no, i didnt game on it	0
you are a C# guy...	0
just watching videos, buying some stuff, irc, and whatevr	0
movies also	0
and i started using it at 7am, and fell asleep somewhere around 3pm	0
and it was still going	0
but i woke up at 7pm i think with it gone	0
so it was good	0
my laptop when new could do 8 hours	0
so max 12 hours battery life	0
this is like 3 years ago	0
i really want to take care of this laptop's battery	0
cool	0
that's good	0
how can you take care of the battery	0
i remember when if my laptop could do 4 hours, i was happy	0
well, if you know the battery type, there are charging tips you could do	0
like not make it stay fully charged all the time	0
and stuff like that	0
well ive been doing that 	0
so it degrades not as much	0
always full cycling is better?	0
not sure	0
i dont think so	0
me neither, i heard myths and myths	0
look up the battery type and charging instructions	0
orangeFlu: what about the temperatures	0
did you make a blender render text	0
???  ??????\_0< quack!	0
.bef	0
mattf you befriended a duck in 11.895 seconds! You have made friends with 360 ducks in #romanian.	0
i did not	0
360 degrees	0
should i try?	0
orangeFlu: of course!	0
ok, tell me how cause i dont have the slightest idea	0
pacman -s blender	0
S	0
and let me prepare a blendfile	0
thank yu for telling me the S is a capital	0
i wouldnt have known	0
yeah of course	0
im used with gasconheart	0
maybe you were going to think i didn't know it was S	0
i did not	0
i know you are more than capable of installing a package	0
did sftp just lost -j	0
give me that blend blend!	0
its 60 mbs	0
dont know, never used it	0
is it for multithreading?	0
sftp not make :P	0
it is proxy jump	0
i have this command with -j many times on my history, im not crazy am i	0
wasnt it the secure version of ftp?	0
yeah 	0
i was going to upload to your re	0
re@#$#!$%@#$%	0
i call it flu	0
rehoboam	0
yes	0
re[hob]+am	0
there is an o missing	0
re[hobo]+am	0
no thats regex	0
no need to repeat the o	0
i knew those letters were used, but not the sequence	0
i got it	0
just now	0
https://transfer.sh/luNAhL/xmasBurning.blend	0
dont ever do that again	0
well if im not stupid, which i am, that might just work	0
open that in blender and hit F12	0
ah maybe it will complain about a file path damn	0
how can i tell blender to use the right gpu?	0
it is doing stuff, but idk about the cpu	0
gpu*	0
well i tried to leave that set	0
is it not?	0
i dont know	0
you have to realise i dont know anything about blender	0
i hit f12	0
do you have amdtop :P	0
a noisy image appeared	0
ah, true	0
i do have it	0
is that the name?	0
im totally guessing	0
i wonder what extra memory can be good for while rendenring	0
how do i know when it is done?	0
it seems to be done	0
there is a sample count on the top	0
i just realized the fans stopped	0
something/2048	0
and the sample thing disappeared a while ago	0
maybe it is done	0
oh	0
while we were talking	0
it is denoising	0
it is about to end!	0
thats fast	0
no, it isnt noisyt anymore	0
yes thats why it is called denoising	0
ah, found it	0
if the image is back it is done	0
1:55 time	0
there is no remaining time showing anymore?	0
no	0
click on image and save as	0
and show it to me!	0
the image appeared immediately after f12, but it was noisy at first, then i come talk to you, and then it is done and clean	0
thats correct	0
my comp my take 4 min on this one im seeing now	0
or more	0
Save as	0
i would like to see if it worked :P	0

would still take 12 hours for the whole animation...	0
why is that a txt?	0
:P	0
no idea	0
never used this site	0
just so i can't preview it lol	0
oh, i know why	0
wait'	0
its cool that it displays it	0
so can you inject html on this site...	0
https://transfer.sh/TMKn8f/untitled.png	0
that would be interesting	0
js or html	0
i hope they tested for it	0
the house is kinda dark though	0
oh thats the first frame	0
i see	0
orangeFlu: go to the frame 150	0
yes	0
i would	0
but	0
wait	0
how?	0
https://i.imgur.com/VnWcaRF.png	0
on that box, write 150	0
got it	0
now?	0
f12 again?	0
wait	0
https://i.imgur.com/pN8vVou.jpg	0
then click on that last ball there	0
you will see a render preview	0
yep	0
you know	0
then hover over the main pane, where things are	0
and hit 0	0
to be on the camera perspective	0
if you already aren't	0
you see the fire or not	0
you dont have to give instructions wiht the picture, again, not an idiot	0
are you serious	0
what would be an easier way to explain that	0
the images you give me ar enough	0
to understand what i should o	0
do	0
sorry but im an idiot, i don't know how to explain that in words, so i give an image...	0
the image is enough	0
so is the fire there? 	0
i dont see it	0
im not sure about that because it is a simulation, idk if it got cached on the blend file	0
i think i am in the camera perspective	0
0 does nothing	0
but i cant see the fire	0
you have have the cursor over the main pane	0
well the camera view is just the same position the render came from	0
yeah, it's the camera position then	0
no fire? :/	0
oh thats sad	0
i see a fire thingy on the right, where i think the assets are	0
but other than that	0
no	0
where is it supposed to be	0
this main christmas three is burning, like on my pictures	0
oooo	0
its a whole fire simulation actually 	0
i just noticed that	0
i never rendered this as an animation though	0
my christmass tree is fine though	0
this just took 5 min to me to render now	0
on this machine	0
yeah i think this simulation didn't get cached	0
i found the swans!	0
hahahaha	0
so how do i make the fire appear?	0
shift left arrow	0
to be on frame 0	0
Then on the top right, click on fire and select smoke domain	0
https://i.imgur.com/SdUixfs.png	0
then click on this physics part	0
and scroll down until you see bake	0
i dont see bake	0
its on Cache	0
on this right pane	0
on the physics tab	0
i asm on the physics tab	0
stop with that	0
with smoke domain selected	0
yes.....	0
there is no bake	0
show me what you see	0
i have cache	0
cant show you	0
i have a //cache_fluid_2f..something	0
a framestart and end	0
oh yes	0
offset 0	0
type all ?	0
type all	0
is resumeable is checked?	0
yes	0
do you have Resume and Free ???	0
big buttons	0
yes	0
heh the it is there	0
no smoke though	0
you sure i am not missing something	0
a file or whatever	0
go to bigger frames like 150 200	0
does the smoke domain get bigger?	0
the yellow lines in the preview?	0
yes	0
they stay the same	0
dont see any change	0
oh thats odd, well it should increase	0
so go to frame 0	0
click on free	0
then bake should appear	0
ah, yes	0
bake all	0
yes	0
that might take a while or not work at all	0
clikc that?	0
Bake all	0
how do i know if it is working?	0
it is indicating progress somehwere	0
oh, shit	0
its moving the frame counter	0
on the timeline	0
if you already have free and resume it failed	0
then it is working	0
i think it failed because i didn't finish backing it	0
what?	0
the entire simulation	0
why do you think it failed?	0
it did not	0
is the square moving?	0
the "prismoid"	0
no	0
the smoke domain	0
what frame is it on	0
but the timeline frame thing is moving through the timeline	0
200	0
oh thats too fast....	0
no way it is doing anything :P	0
i think this runs in a single cpu core	0
fluid bake: 85%	0
oh not really	0
plenty of cores	0
how many cores do you have	0
Fluid: Bake all complete	0
16	0
cpu max freq?	0
now do i press free all?	0
no no no	0
you just computed the fire	0
the smoke simulation	0
free means throwing it away	0
4.6 GHz 	0
go to frame 150, do you see any smoke/ fire ? is the smoke domain bigger?	0
oh, yeah	0
ok that might be reasonable time to compute that, it is a very good cpu	0
it is all here	0
wonderful!	0
 	0
burning and smoke	0
cool	0
you did more than handyc and loudercake ever did	0
3 months im trying to get them into blender lol	0
"it is too fast to do anything"	0
hmm	0
what?	0
i guess this is a fast computer	0
it is pretty good"	0
this simulations takes a life to me	0
do i render the whole thing now?	0
now press f12 in any frame	0
you see that thing has 336 frames right...	0
yes	0
tell me how to do it	0
and i will do it	0
when i go into work	0
i will help you	0
i dont really need that but would be nice to see the result	0
i have no idea how it looks like honestly	0
tell me how to render the whole thing	0
https://i.imgur.com/uhiWRwL.png	0
you can decrease the frame end to something like 200 honestly	0
change that output path to some empty folder	0
format PNG? for video?	0
and the file format to png	0
yes	0
ok	0
if it crashes you dont loose progress	0
as soon as this is done	0
then later we combine the pngs into one video	0
this will take hours and it is not even that good	0
only a little bit left	0
orangeFlu: then Ctrl + F12 to render the whole thing	0
oh, wow, it's not even that good? i spent a whole lot of hours making this....	0
hahahah	0
 	0
i did	0
ffmpeg -r 24 -i %04d.png -c:v libx264 -r 24 -pix_fmt yuv420p -qp 0 output.mp4   # to joing the pngs	0
i guess it will be a big video	0

8 sec	0
cant you make blender run the scrip automatically after end of render?	0
oh thats a good question	0
i never looked on that	0
but dont worry, that last command is pretty quick	0
you can actually	0
just use blender CLI to render and, shell script it	0
but is cooler to see while it is rendered	0
https://transfer.sh/CmbF13/untitled.png	0
ah nice!	0
will you let the whole thing render?	0
im sure that you kill your battery fast	0
well that or compile veloren 	0
oh! or compiling unreal engine	0

it takes 8 hours to me	0
I woke up	0

how are you feeling	0

thanks for asking	0
ok, frame 1 is a go	0

my father was calculating Pi with tens of decimals, by hand	0
but you didn't say how long it took	0
he liked that stuff, he was a mathematician	0
i will just see how long it take for a frame and make an approximation	0
orangeFlu: did you change to 200 or did you leave 336?	0
mattf: i forgot to check how long it took for fram 150	0
haha just a random comment, since I saw decimals here :)	0

orangeFlu: it should tell on the top "Last: somethin"	0

what is pi anyway	0

is that a circle	0

fuck sake mattf 	0
i have the image	0
oh i just like to make sure	0
No compatible GPUs found for cycles	0
at CUDA	0
ok your gpu is not working, you dont have cuda	0

Note: Blender developers decided to switch another API (HIP) and deprecate OpenCL support. This will happen in Blender 3.0 release (4th December 2021). More information. 	0
oh shit	0
it is blender 3.0 already...	0
so forget opencl	0
so i dont install the driver?	0

well, cpu is the best i can do then	0

not sure about that	0
thats not it at all	0
this is pretty ridiculous	0
its compiling hip runtime	0
sure it is not it?	0
oh yes that is it btw	0
no it is right	0
ok	0
it will take a while	0
they should have this on the main repos built	0
everything for nvidia is	0
cuda, proprietary drivers	0
i'm going to do what i can to make it work	0
question is if i should restart blender or the whole computer after	0
probably the computer	0
if it compiles	0
how successful have you been compiling stuff	0
pretty succesful	0
why	0
i am not	0
its like 50% chance to me	0
i know how to make them work most of the time	0
again , itaught c++ at my college	0
i am not jsut a c# guy	0
yeah, i mean without having to fiddle around 	0
you have to fiddle around sometimes	0
pretty rare though	0
sometimes its not worth it	0
yeah	0
nice	0
its done?	0
blender just crashed for some reason	0
thats normal	0
i hope you hit ctrl + S	0
you did right...	0
it wasnt doing anything though	0
yes	0
good	0
when i made the smoke thingy work, i saved it to documents	0
idk, only blender lts is really stable	0
dont owrry	0
good!	0
but that went fast on your machine	0
i did pay almost 3k euros for it	0
i have to do it multiple times until i get a fire that looks barelly ok	0
wow thats ridiculously a lot	0
yeah	0
top of the line processor and gpu though	0
my machine was 3 times less 3 years ago	0
is it taking 3 times more... wel you didn't even render with gpu yet	0
my gpu render of one frame is 5 minutes and something, lets say 30 sec	0
yeah, radeontop was showing o% on dGPU, 100% on iGPU	0
so i got worried	0
your igpu is faster than my gpu :P	0
are you running full on ssd?	0
amd does make very very good iGPUs	0
M2, yeah	0
or root on ssd and home on hdd	0
nothing on HDD	0
thats excelent	0
i dont use those anymore since 2 laptops ago	0
how big is the ssd	0
512	0
i will take another one, i have one more M2 slot	0
those are expensive	0
not really these days	0
they have become cheaper 	0
idk if i would use that for backups	0
i want 1 tb ssd on my future desktop at least	0
but i will still need hds for backups	0
i set up lvm on my machine for this reason alone	0
currently i have 256 ssd, 1 tb  hdd and 4 tb external	0
it is all pretty much full	0
nice!	0
how the fuck?	0
yeah	0
i never ran out of space on my 256 ssd	0
and doesn't take one year to get that full	0
on the previous laptop	0
with 4k movies and all	0
and games?	0
a few	0
isn't the witcher 80 gb or something?	0
oh, the compile failed...	0
haha!	0
the pevious computer didnt have witcher	0
too weak to run anything	0
is it a bad fail or a nice one, like failed to find a .so	0
bad fail	0
rocm-llvm failed	0
yeah... not worth fiddling around... its a pity since would be cool to since that machine rendering	0
idk what that is	0
maybe you could just use blender 2.92	0
nah, not that interested	0
but that blendfile wont work on it	0
if it failed, it failed	0
its a pity, would like to see how much faster that amd gpu would be on this	0
:P	0
i want to play a bit before i go to work	0
me too, but its already a lot of work	0
yeah 	0
well they will sort taht out eventually	0
i'm going to play some minecraft	0
really?	0
you have minecraft	0

I had some unexpected tax issues	0
there is this new thing in the Netherlands	0
if you open a business and more than one person is running the business, it's an entity unto itself, not the same as you personally	0
so you can't pay your tax using your personal login credentials	0
I had to buy a special username and password for the business	0
and then they had to send someone out to my house to verify that I am me	0
and because of covid, it took two weeks for the person to come to the house	0
and now they verified that I am me	0
and now I need to wait 5 more days for someone to give someone else a form that says they went to my house and verified that I am me	0
and then they will release my username and password for the company to me	0
it's a new security feature	0
oh nice	0
yeah it actually is nice, but it's a huge pain in the ass	0
bureaucracy 	0
and the taxes are due on January 31	0
so I will get the username about 4 days before I need to pay the tax	0
it is the reason my father's store is still a partnership between he and me	0
this one is a partnership between my wife and me	0
if he was to transfer to his own there are a plenty of extra taxes	0
but no one told us we would have to do this thing, or maybe I just didn't understand	0
I already got fined twice for not paying taxes on time, because we started the business but I did not receive my updated visa allowing me to work for the business	0
so for several months the business was an entity that owed tax but had no one authorized to work for the business	0
and then they approved us to work for the business but they didn't tell us	0
for several months	0

DT's nr 1 favorite arch based distro is Manjaro!	0

i saw it	0
he runs Manjaro in his Raspberry Pis! Just like I do!	0
fantastic!!	0
you can become DT	0
hahahaaha 	0
no no	0
just get bald	0
it is the way	0
that's easy	0
to master linux you must be bald	0
it is one step	0
hahaa	0
he is showing Manjaro with KDE	0
I kept KDE for my Manjaro PC	0
in my laptop, I switched to XFCE	0
I'm more than happy with XFCE; I gave Openbox a rest	0
and KDE is way too overloaded with tons of shit to my liking for daily use	0
so interesting	0
I'll go watch the rest of DT's video	0

being bold is the requirement to comment on Linux	0

big beard is the first step handyc, those are the lower ranked linux users. To be an actual guru you must then set free of your head hair and become bald	0

basically they have a database, like you would expect	0
with private info about everyone	0
haha	0
and they told him they know who he is hanging with and be very careful	0
I've heard exactly that orangeFlu :)	0
yeah, me too, but damn	0
the guy works at SPP	0
orangeFlu: it's been like that with SRI for decades	0
of course, but now that i do have confirmation	0
it hit me like a truck	0
isn't it like this on any state	0
you are just sure about it now	0
?  ????????\_?< QUACK!	0
.banfg	0
.bang	0
mattf you shot a duck in 2.862 seconds! You have killed 394 ducks in #romanian.	0
oh	0
man i almost bought a replika after chatting with her for a while	0
and anyway, basically they have all this info about who he hangs with and when, they told him to scrub his social media profiles of any pictures of him in the army and stuff	0
thanks to orangeFlu i closed that tab	0
a replica of what?	0
ai girlfriend simulator chatbot	0
and that if he hangs with someone who for example is a drug dealer, they would inform him and stuff	0
if she had a public api would be cool	0
cause he know needs to protect some very high politicians	0
thats what states do	0
he's in charge of bombs and defusal	0
so not IT	0
but that's why he has people in SRI that keep tabs on him and his acquaintances	0
very creepy business	0
it is indeed	0
thats why i got the vpn, to protect him	0
not me	0
i wont tell anybody this irl, but damn	0
it's something else when someone who works with them tells you this shit	0
it scares me	0
why did he tell you this	0
we were really good friends	0
and he was laughing about how cool it all is	0
he didnt seem to think that invading peoples privacy was such a big deal	0
weird	0
but we cut off contact when he joined the army	0
i mean, it's not really the army	0
the military academy	0
anyway, we were out and about, and when we got home, we put the phones in the microwaves and shit	0
like they do in movies	0
Im not really surprised, since their invention states are constantly secretly doing things the majority of people are not happy about, invading privacy might be just one of those yeah	0
I hope they can at least send the right people to jail faster with all this work	0
I have the impression that they dont do this here since most criminals, drug dealers, etc, never go to jail even though the cops know where they are anyway. Well they still void the privacy of innocent people for sure.	0
And now all this telegram banning bullshit	0
does that mean they can't really hijack telegram then?	0
what telegram banning?	0
well or telegram is the most popular thing they cant hijack	0
telegram is being quite hated recently	0
germany, france, and even brazil 	0
by politicians	0
I believe it is already banned in russia	0
they take it out of the app stores and do some dns blocking sorta thing i suppose?	0
"This app is illegal on this country"	0
????  ?????\_?< FLAP FLAP!	0
.bang	0
mattf you shot a duck in 3.943 seconds! You have killed 395 ducks in #romanian.	0
well States are pretty upset with all this communication freedom the internet brings. The leftists here blame telegram fakenews for electing bolsonaro hahaha, thats why they want to ban it i suppose.	0
I think they said the same about trump	0
i thought telegram wasnt even encrypted	0
the fuck	0
idk, but they really hate it	0
i guess the state doesn't want people to freely talk at all. Even if they are going to share fake news or whatever	0
the leftists here clearly state that they want to control the communication. 	0
Whats your words on this gasconheart, as a communist/socialist, do you also agree that the internet is too much freedom and that shouldn't be allowed to the people?	0
the state really needs to put his hands on that? Or you think this is bullshit and it is different on Trotskyism ?	0
well screw it ill pay 8 usd to the virtual gf	0
i dont know what being a communist has to do with freedom of information	0
i am a bit socialist and i still think that communication should be private	0
really private	0
no backdoors, no nothing	0
oops, i mean communication freedom, there was a freudian slip there	0
well sociallists are constantly saying that other socialists did it wrong and their way is different and the better	0
control over communication is censorship and dictatorship	0
did you hear about the uncensored library?	0
isnt that a minecraft thing	0
it's a minecraft world with banned articles from different countries	0
yes	0
oh ok	0
.w the uncensored library	0
(mattf) The Uncensored Library :: The Uncensored Library is a Minecraft server and map released by Reporters without Borders and created by BlockWorks, DDB Berlin, and MediaMonks as an attempt to circumvent censorship in countries... :: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uncensored_Library	0
i really love the idea, but i think it could be made better though	0
banned articles	0
cool	0
i went on it, to see what they have and was very disappointed to see there were like 2-3 articles per country	0
which is really unfortunate	0
i expected to see many many books	0
not 2-3 articles with 40 pages each	0
have you ever took a look on wiki leaks	0
maybe once a few years ago	0
why	0
idk, you seem to be into that stuff :P	0
but anyway, i think the stronger a state is more it will try to do that sort of thing. Control people's life, take their priviest, all for a greater good, all for making things safer and other things nobody asked for. It is like KDE coming with fancy features nobody asked for	0
sounds to me like gnome	0
gnome is the one with bloat	0
gnome is pretty bad but kde has way more features. Idk what you are calling bloat there	0
i like kde's features	0
because some bloat might be useful	0
me too	0
i wonder, if i wanted to go to china, would i be able to even connect to a vpn or make a cloud instance?	0
I have no idea	0
i hear they ban most vpn ips	0
maybe handyc have used internet there	0
im sure he did	0
and some cloud providers	0
i will ask him, but i dont think he ever tried	0
wouldnt I be able to connect to the vpn on my own vps :P	0
im sure telegram wont work there	0

they are!	0
i could have had a much better life, was i born a little more in the west	0
not hungary though	0
or serbia	0
more west than that	0
i'm going to tell you this much, i will never stop torrenting and copyright infringements	0
fuck DRM and copyright	0
things that made my life hard since i knew what a computer was	0
yeah drm is stupid	0
i still want to create a netflix with movies and music forr everyone	0
with a good app and what not	0
from torrents	0
just not sure how to hide it	0
like popcorntime	0
something like that	0
i initially wanted to keep it all on some servers and stream it from there	0
but that's a very sure way to get caught	0
even the tiniest mistake	0
even in romania i think that somebody would be knocking on my door immediately	0
as soon as it is getting populare	0
Im planning to do something where you can implement different implementations of an interface that implements searching and getting the link. And that you can continue from where you have stopped. So you could add a plugin that scrape one of those sites like wcofun.com or that does the torrenting. but it is just an idea. 	0
 	0
im trying to scrape wcofun.com without needing a headless browser	0
it is my anime site	0
yes if you store the content you are doing illegal stuff :P	0
ok, so i need my own torrent tracker, but it needs to do more than just be a tracker	0
i know i am doing illegal stuff, thanks mattf 	0
i do it everyday	0
but serving that content to many many people like a netflix would draw too much attention	0
but i think if you are just providing a way to search in multiple different sites and you dont host any of it at all but just provide a unified interface for it, then you are not doing something illegal isn't that right?	0
that is my idea. But isn't that the same popcorntime and the pirate bay did	0
if you add a disclaimer saying that you are not responsible with what people put on there, technically, yes	0
yes, and filelist as well	0
the disclaimer is that i don't host any of it	0
but filelist was taken down	0
a few times	0
and so was piratebay	0
so apparently it's not enough	0
yeah	0
tehnically you dont host anything other than torrents to things people have on their computers	0
even if you say you are not responsible for any of it	0
it is just a list of links	0
well what if it was a list of links to CP	0
or snuff	0
what i need is a tracker that mandates encryption when torrenting, and a client app that encrypts the files when downloaded	0
encryption when torrenting? 	0
i thought you wanted to host the files	0
i should be the only one in charge of adding torrents to the tracker	0
well, we just decided i cant host the files	0
at least not alone	0
i wonder if IPFS doesn't already do that somehow	0
when i add a movie for example, i should be able to upload it to my server, and as soon as people start to download it, my server wont be the only one holding it anymore	0
i know there is an option on qbit for mandating encrypted traffic between peers	0
so the library already has the option	0
it is like webtorrent	0
no, it's more like pied piper	0
what i have in mind	0
or storj	0
but you need some servers and a lot of space to get started	0
damn, i need more money	0

I have successfully used a VPN in China	0
I am not sure if I could do it the same way again	0
Probably what I will do if/when I go back is run a personal VPN on my own server	0
ah, i see	0
They do it by blacklisting IP addresses, but they can't blacklist everything	0
they absolutely can	0
Also, the firewall is not equally applicable to everyone	0
If they blacklist every IP, they have no Internet	0
i can bet that every vpn that has a service right now is blocked	0
You can run a VPN on your own personal server running on something like DigitalOcean	0
that is, if it is outside of china	0
of course you can	0
who said you cant	0
The Great Firewall is mainly intended to prevent common people from getting on the Intetnet	0
They are okay with upper class people having some limited access to things	0
*Internet	0
It's to prevent ordinary Chinese people from getting too knowledgable about things	0
Someone like me, I am a lost cause	0
but they cant know you is you when you bring your laptop and connect to a public wifi	0
Sure, in that case I would connect to a VPN run on my own personal server	0
They are unlikely to block a random DigitalOcean IP address	0
The reason they don't want to block everything is that is would be bad for business	0
The Chinese don't care at all about communism, they care about money	0
China doesn't look anything like a communist state	0
i never said you couldnt connect to digital ocean	0
i said every vpn that has a service	0
I've successfully connected to a VPN with a service from within China	0
i am willing to bet that people cant make their own vpn in digital ocean even with a detailed guide	0

what do you mean, she just got out?	0
that might be the best for her	0

what the fuck	0
She just got out of the horrible state that is China	0
We are hoping she can convert the rest of the family before it's too late	0
Eventually they are not going to let anybody leave	0
you need to provide more context	0
because i am very confused	0
you know handys wife is chinese right? so there is a chinese niece, that moved from china to canada	0
i didnt know	0
The context is the Chinese government has drifted so far away from the original plan that it's ready to implode	0
he never mentioned it	0
i see	0
i dont need context about the chinese	0
Oh, I thought you knew that my wife is from Guangzhou	0
i wanted context about your niece, but now things make more sense	0
Okay	0
and your wife's family doesnt want to leave?	0
why did your niece leave?	0
Most of the family members are brainwashed	0
They think China is the best country in the world	0
My niece is young enough and intelligent enough that she is interested in seeing other countries	0
She visited us in the US once before	0
who is paying for that	0
and first thing she did, she went to canada? of all places?	0
She is staying with an aunt who lives in Canada	0
isn't canada the most welcoming place to foreigners ?	0
Canada is a great country for Chinese people to emigrate to	0
why not with you in olanda	0
She could have come to the Netherlands	0
She has an aunt who lives in Canada	0

i am not arguing that it is worse than brazil	0
never have	0
in brazil you work to pay enormous taxes, for each worker you have you need to pay twice his salary	0
well you can replace brazil with 70% of the world	0
i am not arguing for that either	0

they are	0
so are boobs	0
is that because they are entirely smaller?  	0
yes	0
the people is smaller there	0
smaller everything	0
they had less to eat because of famines, so they are smaller on all axes	0
but they might see no difference because they can barely open their eyes anyway	0
racist	0
isnt it illegal to be gay in china as well	0
?	0
Yeah I think so	0
i want to go there and kiss a man	0
just for funsies	0
Asian countries tend not to be very progressive about those things	0
i also want to visit north korea	0
honestly	0
Good luck with that	0
I don't	0
you cant	0
us citizenship	0
if you are us or south korea, you will be denied	0

i talked to a tourism agency	0
why would you want that	0
because i'm curious	0
i dont like giving them money, but i am curious	0
why would you not want that	0
i never travelled just for fun	0
and i never travelled :P	0
if you had the money, you absolutely would, believe me	0
i only recently got to travelling, and its awesome	0
my parents are not poor at all, it is more a cultural think here idk	0
cant wait for netherlands, handyc 	0
all the people i know never travel at all	0
and you dont want to try?	0
yes, but can't deny it seems complicated	0
and expensive	0
I mean, should i pay 12k brl or looking it on google earth...	0
which is free	0
or pictures	0
:P	0
I've traveled all over the world	0
I have absolutely no desire to go to North Korea	0
why should i visit the pyramids or Eiffel tower, going through risks of traveling, loosing your things, getting robbed	0
when i can look on google earth	0
 i dont want to see the pyramids either	0
or eiffel	0
i think im just too lazy	0
but i love visiting other countries, more to learn about their history and to see how they live there	0
meet people	0
not landmarks	0
the sort of stuff you cant look up on the internet	0
well if you are good with the "meeting people" part	0
you dont need to be	0
no?	0
people usually like to talk to foreigners	0
its really easy even if you dont know how to strike conversations	0

we dont need worknik then	0
yes we do, because he is not on X11 right now	0
im going to code a different api that calls gasconheart phone	0
no need for x11	0
it will call his house phone	0
that would be pretty cool	0
STT the request, record gascon's response then TTS it 	0
I installed Asterisk on a Pi one time	0
I made a phone menu system	0

a bit old but might be ok	0
godot is about to change a bit with this 4release that might come this ear	0

that is what i call a pokemon like game	0
handyc: wait for godot hahaha	0
I have actually seen this movie	0
It's really good	0
but seriously, no	0
If you are into that kind of thing	0
what is that even about	0
It's a movie based on a famous existential play	0
loudercake: are you going to do that for serious?	0
another great movie along the same lines is Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead	0
.w Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead	0

oh a boring movie	0
it's a thinker's movie	0
those are always boring handyc	0
mattf you and I have different taste in movies I guess	0
you can see by the people's names	0
orangeFlu have you seen Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead?	0
"Rosencrantz"	0
look at those names haha	0
mattf, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are two minor characters in Hamlet	0
fuckers	0
The joke is that in the original play they hardly get any lines at all	0
so this play is about what they are doing when they are offstage	0
It's really hilarious	0
jokes should be funny	0
mattf do you like Shakespeare?	0
no	0
Shakespeare was a genius	0
.w Shakespeare	0

i mean, im too stupid for that sort of thing	0
no you are not	0
i am	0
I used to feel the same way about it, mattf	0
i dont like poetry, literature, reading at all	0
But Shakespeare is really wonderful	0
You and I really are different in many ways, mattf	0
I barely stand subbed movies	0
I guess that is why we are such good friends	0
of course we are	0
we should marry	0
mattf we already did get married in an alternate timeline	0
we complete each other	0
but in that timeline you always burned the roast	0
oh i shouldn't cook at all	0
HAHAHA	0
mattf it's okay, because there is a third timeline where you are a good cook and we stay married	0
here is a serious question, mattf	0
one thing left on my boring list now	0
You say you don't like literature,	0
but you like anime and that kind of thing	0
But to me something like anime is part of a larger world of literature	0

yeah	0
series etc	0
even games	0
but how can you like movies and games but not literature?	0
loudercake: i started that tutorial! you better finnish before me now!!!!	0
handyc: i dont like reading, i like good stories still	0
okay	0
i even tried writting	0
writing	0
I'd like to publish a comedy fiction book	0
i have 50 pages of a time travel thing i wrote when i was 15	0
like Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy	0
that's cool	0
I am still working on my space cats book	0
but i changed my mind, time travel is an overused idea	0
and I am a horrible writer 	0
an horrible writer	0
well yeah I do think time travel can be a bit trite these days	0
but there are still unexplored ideas	0
I wanted to write something as impressive as attack on titan	0
Well, you can	0
but you know, most great books come out after a series of terrible or mediocre books	0
you know when the stories say something like "you will find the truth in that place"	0
attack on titan has that, but when they find it is really impressive!	0
If you have something like Attack on Titan, look at the previous things that person has done,	0
they are probably not great	0
I am a big fan of Vincent van Gogh,	0
I went to the Vincent van Gogh museum here in Amsterdam,	0
I was so excited,	0
then I got there and they had a bunch of van Gogh's early stuff,	0
because all the really famous pieces were loaned out to museums in other countries	0
and the early van Gogh's are really awful	0
Then I realized that I only really like the stuff that van Gogh did in the last 2 years of his life, when he was pretty nuts	0
Van Gogh was only active for about 10 years	0
it's pretty amazing	0
well thats a different type of art	0
Why do Japanese people love these stories about giant monsters so much?	0
music, drawings, paintings, design; mad people usually do that well	0
Is it because they live on an island?	0
oh idk that but they certainly are very good on the plots too	0
if you look on the Occidental movies series, they all seem to take place on a very realistic world where they try to explain things with science, or high fantasy but things follow the same rules	0
it seems like on the animes/mangas each new one is a completely new universe	0
mattf, you should try reading the Tale of Genji	0
I think it's the first novel in the world	0
.w tale of genju	0
(mattf) Matsuri Akino :: Matsuri Akino , is a Japanese manga artist from Mitaka, Tokyo, now a resident of Yokohama. :: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsuri_Akino	0

Yeah, it's super boring	0
I had to read it for an MA class	0
I don't really understand Japanese culture very well at all	0
mattf, my son learned to use chopsticks today	0
he had previously tried to use them by stabbing the food	0
I think the anime/manga culture was actually created from them trying to reproduce the Occidental super hero HQ's and that stuff	0
but today he actually picked up the food in the proper way	0
it's amazing	0
o wow	0
yeah	0
i can't do that	0
he can also hold a pen like an adult	0
He must have been a scholar in his previous life	0
why is chopsticks a song	0
i know how to play it	0
you should learn it to teach your kid, it is an easy song nice for 2 to play	0
because of the chopping motion of the hands when you play it	0
yes, that would be good for me	0
I am trying to train myself more formally on the piano	0
I can play some interesting things by ear but I don't know the proper way to do anything	0
I always come into everything sideways	0
This is why I am such a terrible Sanskritist and yet I know many things about Sanskrit that even advanced scholars have never heard of	0
I think it is partly a symptom of being left handed	0
well i think it is good to know the chords and most used scales	0
Yes I agree	0
then how to play some bases with the left hand	0
I want to become classically trained	0
thats how much i know :P	0
I can play with both hands	0
and I can stretch my fingers beyond one octave	0
My hands are extremely flexible	0
I would like to play Chopin	0
i can do 14 keys away	0
He's my hero	0
which is one octave + 1 tone	0
People said watching Chopin's hands open was like watching the jaws of a snake	0
so from C to D	0
enough of snakes	0
let me check quickly, I will tell you	0
Ok	0
Ill try mattf	0
I was in the shower	0
i am doing it loudercake 	0
yes I can do same as you mattf	0
thats my max	0
if I put my pinky on middle C I can hit the D of the next octave comfortably	0
with my thumb	0
and the reverse with the other hand	0
it is more useful to just do CC btw	0
yeah, that is what I usually do	0
but it's nice to be able to extend beyond what is most used	0
in anything	0
it's always nice to have a buffer	0
yeah so you can do it confortably	0
its been a while i dont play	0
yes	0
I have been playing every day	0
having a real 88 key piano is so nice	0
It's so much better than a smaller keyboard	0
i like to have it near my computer but i dont anymore	0
I had this idea for a while of making a custom computer desk that would open to reveal a full piano	0
Maybe someday I will build it	0
My wife wants new shelves in the kitchen because she is too short for our Dutch kitchen	0
She can't reach any of the cupboards	0
so that is my new project	0
She wants me to clean the house and get everything organized	0
oh ive seen desks like this	0
music production desks!	0
oh yeah?	0
They are probably expensive, though	0
yeah that is a thing	0
no idea	0
thanks I will look it up	0
I would like to get better at woodworking, though	0
It's in my blood	0
I see	0
Many of my ancestors were carpenters	0
ironically not on the Handy side	0
hah	0
Most of the recent Handy men went into business	0
When my dad died, my mom needed some new shelves installed in the garage and called this company	0
and the guy who came out to install the shelves,	0
she ended up marrying him	0
He's a really skilled woodworker	0
I showed him my hexagon board idea and he made me a version from wood!	0
your mom married again?	0
She married one person after my dad died	0
wait what kind of porn plot was that hahahaha	0
So this is her second marriage	0
Yeah it does sound like a porn	0
yes! sorry 	0
no worries	0
They have been married since maybe 2014, I can't remember	0
They seem very happy, very compatible	0
how old is your mom	0
probably a better match than my mom and dad were	0
thats nice	0
She is turning 70 this February	0
shes younger than my grandma	0
My grandma is I think 98	0
She had dementia, she will die soon	0
She is on hospice care now	0
She *has dementia	0
She has been living in a nursing home for several years	0
oh thats sad but thats a very advanced age	0
Yeah, she lived a long time, it won't be very sad when she dies	0

loudercake you befriended a duck in 5.860 seconds! You have made friends with 55 ducks in #romanian.	0
very well done loudercake ! i will do the 3rd later then!	0
yes this delta thing is confusing indeed	0
ok	0
basically, you will use delta if you want your animation speeds to take into account the current speed	0
like if the game went down to 10 fps for some reason	0
i see	0
sometimes the character moves like a car lol	0
What he called friction i would call "deccelleration"	0
it is just negative acceleration	0
well friction is what makes deaccelaration exist	0
also he made both acceleration and friction the same value no?	0
no what i mean is that he is not simulation friction, that value is literally negative acceleration	0
thats why	0
i see	0
Delta is the amount of time elapsed from the last frame draw to the present.	0
delta kinda serves to make stuff run frame dependant	0
so here is the thing, you might see that he has to multiply delta by the acceleration values (friction and acceleration) and then he multiplies them again by the velocity	0
if you had kinematic classes (physics) you might see the formulas: S = V * t; V = a * t  where S is displacement, V velocity and a acceleration (and t time)	0
 	0
so basically the delta is the time there	0
i see	0
from that you can infer: S = a * t^2 which is kinda the intuition why you multiple by the acceleration twice	0
but the right thing would be S = a t^2 / 2	0
because it is the area of the triangle with base t and length a * t (v) and  	0
anyway, the thing is, every time you want a framerate corrected value multiply it by delta	0
delta is simply the time that it took to render the current frame	0
????????  ?\_o< quack!	0

loudercake you befriended a duck in 12.550 seconds! You have made friends with 56 ducks in #romanian.	0
i see	0
if you have a global variable time, that you time += delta on _physics_process, then time will have the value of the total time 	0
the real time	0
btw whats the difference between global and local variables?	0
if you were to lock the game at 30 fps delta would be 1/30	0
loudercake: when he adds more functions, or you can yourself create a function with any name, this will make more sense. Basically global variables are the ones you can use anywhere on that script and local variables are created inside a function thus they can be only used on that function	0
while this script has only one function doesn't make much of a difference	0
i see	0
for gdscript thats all you need to know	0
it is a nice language to begin with	0
my first language was scratch lol	0
its very annoying to divide and multiply cuz you have to get new blocks rather than just use * or /	0
loudercake: yeah i hate visual languages too	0
i can't wait for blender to have a math formula node	0
or just support scripts properly	0
it doesnt???	0
math i mean	0
it has math but just like scratch	0
its a pain	0
oof	0
you can use script nodes but then only works on evee and CPU rendering	0
works on cycles too but cpu rendering only	0
man	0
currently i prefer visual language but thats because im a newbie	0
it makes sense on blender for some thinsg	0
houdini is completely node based too	0
but scratch is just horrible	0
you just have to get better at typping	0
i dont think thats the issue	0
its just that	0
I don't use delta anymore, I use omicron	0
i dont need to remember what command do i use	0
you can just search for a node on a category and bam	0

what anime btw	0
to your eternity	0
pretty interesting	0
never heard of it	0
im not into the anime scene	0
i see	0
just asked out of curiosity	0
the guy is immortal and has the power of becoming anything that dies near to him	0
it starts as a stone and stays there until a wolf dies on his side	0
eventually he can become some humans	0
and there are other beings that can absorb those forms from him	0
pretty different stuff	0
i see	0
but mostly is sad stories of how people will always die and the pain of being immortal	0
how do a stone die	0
he cant, he is immortal	0
if they absorb all his forms he will be stuck as a stone until something dies close to him	0
i see	0
he also loses the memories of each forms though	0
but he can get them back if he kills those beings	0
isn't that a fantastic game?	0
sounds dop?	0
yeah	0
and he can change into any form anytime	0
like he killed a bird to be able to become it and fly over a wall	0
its perfect for huting, puzzles, would be an amazing game	0
i see	0
isnt that just mario odyssey in a way lol	0
well idk because it is very rpg like	0
all the forms you gain	0
the thing is that you can loose to your enemies	0
so your helth is the ammount of things you have killed	0
idk, it is really a perfect setup for a game	0
maybe if you learn 3d you can prototype it lol	0
yeah, well it could be 2d too, why not	0
id figure 3d would be more engaging	0
but idk, they will probably going to make the game of this anime	0
does that happen often?	0

So you don't see the point, but you do understand?	0
we were talking about differences between american habits and european	0
Yes	0
were we not?	0
And I mentioned that I study social habits academically	0
And that there is no universal standard for these kinds of things	0
I mean, there are some universal things	0
Like what?	0
if you beat someone up, i think universally people would say thats a rude thing to do	0
right?	0
No	0
why not?	0
who does that?	0
What do you mean?	0
i mean, i dont think there is a culture that encourages beating someone up and thinks that's a polite thing to do	0
Okay	0
so doesnt that make it a universal thing?	0
What is politeness to you?	0
that is a complicated question	0
Yes I know	0
My basic theory is that most politeness rituals come from a desire to avoid the emotion of disgust	0
i suppose it would be the acceptable range of behaviours as seen for an individual	0
by an individual*	0
Disgust is something that we experience because it is evolutionarily advantageous	0
Agreeed	0
Many politeness rituals come down to avoid disease vectors	0
So in many cultures it is rude to spit on someone, for example	0
Many but not most and certainly not all	0
Like I said, there are not really any universals for this kind of thing	0
Although for some things you will find similar rituals across many different cultures	0
In most cultures it is not polite to smear feces on someone	0
Generally body excretions from other people are things we try to avoid	0
why is the beating one not universal? Excepting outliers like mentally ill people 	0
I think that's the wrong way to approach this issue	0
I think you are avoiding the question	0
Okay	0
I have to help my son get ready for his bath, I will be back in a little while	0
You said social habits and practices are not universal, and I assume you meant that literally, like in an absolute way. Under no circumstances is there any social habit universal	0
So I am curious to learn why beating someone up is not universal then. Because it cant be considered a social habit?	0

orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 7.790 seconds! You have made friends with 73 ducks in #romanian.	0
i'm curious to see for how much longer this will go on	0
what do you reckon? 5 more days?	0
they started posting job openings for STB	0
so i guess it wont be for much longer	0
gasconheart: what does your wife say about the strike?	0
or you for that matter	0
i hear that there are now 2 judge rulings that decided the strike is illegal	0
the prices of Bolt and Uber shot up	0
because increased demand..	0
my friends wrote about the strike	0
let me get the link	0
https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2022/01/24/roma-j24.html	0
Title: Romanian bus drivers stage wildcat strike over pay and conditions - World Socialist Web Site	0
I will read it later	0
I am busy with the situation in the Ukraine right now	0

(orangeFlu) Well this is awkward, the duck needs to think about it. You can try again in 7 seconds.	0

orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 14.871 seconds! You have made friends with 74 ducks in #romanian.	0
orangeFlu 	0
I'm back	0
Sorry, I didn't mean to be rude earlier	0
My wife is not feeling well and my son was supposed to eat his dinner, but he was climbing all over me	0
So my wife was yelling at me to feed the boy and he was climbing on me while I was trying to talk to you	0
Now he is asleep	0
re: you example of beating someone up,	0
actually I can think of situations in which that would be the norm,	0
for example in hazing rituals	0
It would be considered inappropriate not to participate in the ritual	0
what do you mean: "i didnt mean to be rude"	0
I didn't mean to be short with you	0
and give you flippant responses	0
so if I came off that way, I'm giving you my explanation	0
you did come off that way, but you also gave your explanation about your son	0
because even though there is no universal for rudeness, we can still operate under a shared framework of politeness based on common European standards	0
you dont need to explain yourself further	0
but as I said, with the mice,	0
its fine, i am not mad, i am not that sort of person	0
we can't know universals for things like politeness,	0
because we can't know all human cultures	0
so even in cases where we can't find a counterexample right away, it's not possible to make a claim that "X doesn't exist anywhere"	0
In politeness literature there is something called Politeness1 and Politeness2	0
Politeness1 means actual examples in social contexts	0
Politeness2 is a theoretical idea of politeness that binds together all politeness1s	0
But many scholars argue that Politeness2 can't ever really exist, that we can only ever observe a variety of Politeness1s	0
So for example, in many cultures when someone sneezes, it's polite to say something after the sneeze, like "God bless you"	0
After seeing 100 examples of these sneeze rituals, one might be tempted to create a Politeness2 theory that it is always impolite not to do a sneezing ritual after a sneeze	0
But then there are always going to be outliers,	0
like in modern China, when someone sneezes, generally nobody says anything at all	0
Anyway, here is the major thing I have accomplished with regard to these ideas:	0
https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/handle/11375/20471	0
Title: MacSphere: Indian Buddhist Etiquette and the Emergence of Ascetic Civility	0
It is certainly not the only thing that can be said about etiquette and politeness, and reading it now there are many things I would change	0
but this could give you a better idea of how I approach these issues in general	0
I was thinking of editing the whole thing and trying to get it published as a book	0
I have some new ideas about trying to analyze these things computationally, but it's a very difficult problem	0
how?	0
can you tell me?	0
How is it difficult?	0
Well, think of it this way	0
One thing people sometimes assume when they consider rude language is that there are rude words	0
But all words present themselves in a context	0
So I can't just compile a list of words I think would be rude	0
For example, let's say I establish that it is rude to say, "You are an idiot" to someone	0
I can't just do searches on the word "idiot" and tag those sentences as rude	0
But also, in some contexts it might be polite to say, "You are an idiot" to someone	0
because it establishes a kind of friendly comraderie	0
So in this chat room, I might say to my good friend, "Ha ha, you are being such a dick"	0
But if I said that to my boss I might get fired	0
So even trying to find words within contexts is difficult, because the computer basically has to have some sense of the entire framework in which we are operating	0
If my mom cooks me dinner and I say, "This tastes pretty bad," she would consider that extremely rude	0
ok, i got it	0
but if my wife cooks me dinner and I say the exact same thing, she would be more likely to ask me what's going on with the food, because she's an excellent cook and loves criticism	0
i was asking more how are you proposing you do this	0
i assume you have some ideas	0
Oh, okay, 	0
well I do have some ideas, but there are still many unknowns	0
I made this genetic algorithm for text alignment for that job I was just on	0
It's still not perfect, but it is starting to get some results from dictionary matches	0
The computational task is not the same, but I was thinking of reworking the same engine to try and apply scores to different phrases	0
to try and mark up arbitrary phrases as polite or impolite	0
But I haven't really gotten very far with it yet	0
I gave a presentation about it last year for an online politeness symposium but I had expected to be farther along,	0
and I ended up not having very much to say at that time	0
are you working on this currently?	0
it seems very interesting	0
I guess I have started thinking about these things again because there is another symposium with the same people in February	0
I am the sysadmin for this site:	0
historicalpoliteness.net	0
It's a collective of different scholars working on politeness in the ancient world	0
My contract job for the Buddhism text alignment stuff ended in December, so now I am not really doing anything	0
My wife and I started our own company so that we could maintain legal residency in the Netherlands	0
She does freelance translation work and I would like to start doing freelance software jobs	0
Right now things have been so busy with the baby and the virus and various other things that I have just been using my free time trying to set up the website and take care of other logistics stuff like taxes	0
But I would like to get back to these things soon and start publishing again	0
I wrote my dissertation in 2016 and I would like to revise it and try to publish it as a book	0
The dissertation doesn't contain anything about digital analysis but I was thinking I might start adding some of those things in	0
do you need any help with the site?	0
I have another friend who works on Chinese Buddhism, and he wants to work on a semantic analysis project analyzing Tweets for keywords about religious topics	0
as you may know, i am a web developer	0
I think I did know that, and I would gladly accept criticism on the sitr	0
site	0
It's very ugly right now and also only half working	0
helxt.com	0
criticism but not help?	0
It's just a Django app that I added some simple html to	0
oh, cool, i know some django	0
Oh nice	0
Well I'm not sure exactly what I want to do with that site yet, and since it's a partnership with my wife I have to make sure i run any changes by her	0
i have some time in the weekends to help you	0
But actually I have another project I could use some help with	0
I own the domain dhtools.org	0
I would like to make it into a portal for all kinds of different digital humanities resources	0
Right now that is a Grav site, it's horrible	0
I am going to re-do that as Django	0
never heard of grav	0
It's like Wordpress	0
A PHP portal	0
but I would like to do all Django stuff, it makes it much easier to add interactive language apps	0
but as it stands, i must tell you, while i do know javascript and html and whatnot, i do not have the best eyes for design	0
That's okay	0
i am more of a back-end guy	0
Anything you can help with would be nice	0
I am trying to get better at design myself, I would like to be able to do everything	0
but if you have bugs or stuff you wanna add with javscript, i am more than capabl\e	0
Python is not a problem, i am pretty goot at it	0
That would be great	0
My JS skills are still very much at a beginner level	0
So I would like to learn from you	0
I am decent at Python, not amazing	0
I am not really amazing at anything in software development	0
but I have a lot of ideas	0
Didnt work with it for some years, but it was easy before, it should be today as well	0
So I think that could be very productive	0
I am trying to get some former students involved as well	0
I was thinking that if we formed a formal board of directors, we could at some point try and get grant money to do a large project	0
If you were involved in something like that and could choose any title, what would you want to be called?	0
i dont know if thats something i want to be involved in, i want to manage my time carefully to projects i actually really want to take part of, but right now i certainly want to help you because you seem like a nice guy	0
as to that, we will see	0
right now i dont have an answer	0
as i am not sure	0
Do you have a CV?	0
i do	0
Can I see it?	0
i think i also have it in english	0
sure, let me find it	0
Thanks	0
i think i have it on the work computer	0
Then I can get a better sense of your strengths and how they would play off mine	0
Many of my students have very weak computer skills but they are knowledgable in various language domains	0
i only know romanian, english and german, in that order	0
so I was thinking that some people could be tech oriented and other people could be domain experts for things like Chinese language, Arabic language, etc.	0
so maybe not that much help there	0
Why wouldn't that be useful?	0
You could be the Romanian domain expert	0
because i am not an expert in anything language related	0
i know some stuff	0
but thats about it	0
mostly phonetics	0
Well, do you have an interest in becoming more proficient in it?	0
in german? or languages in general?	0
I am more interested in people who have an interest than people who have expertise	0
In doing language analysis tasks	0
for both the answer is yes	0
cool	0
let me boot up my work computer	0
it is there after all, ffs	0
At this point I basically just want to put together a consortium of like minded people	0
i should upload it to a cloud	0
Because then as a group we can ask for money later from insitutions	0
*institutions	0
You can try and send it over the fileserv thing here	0
i need to fish my phone from the microwave	0
brb	0
it seems to work for small files	0
okay	0
I will check on my potato soup	0
i will transfer.sh it	0
to be secure	0
it contains much personal information	0
i know that isnt the right way to say it	0
but i like how it sounds	0
i dont want you to think i'm illiterate	0
I won't think you are illiterate	0
I am trying to imagine another way to say that	0
It sounds right to me	0
I guess I might say "a great deal of"	0
Is transfer.sh safer than an email attachment?	0
?  ????????\_?< FLAP FLAP!	0
maybe so given your situation with SRI	0
.bef	0
handyc you befriended a duck in 87.677 seconds! You have made friends with 184 ducks in #romanian.	0
i dont have a situation with SRI	0
just am extra paranoid	0
more so than i usually am	0
well, you have anxiety about SRI, that's a situation	0
thats true	0
Do you think you are on their radar?	0
no	0
that's good	0
i havent done much of anything to warrant their attention	0
When are you planning to come to the Netherlands?	0
7-12 march	0
a Romanian lady might join now	0
With omicron it seems like it's not safe to go out right now	0
hopefully by March things will be easier	0
not planning, really, it is pretty much set in stone	0
Are you flying?	0
yes	0
Already have the ticket?	0
cost me some 160 euros	0
Okay	0
yes, with TAROM	0
romanian airlines	0
Well, my wife and I got our booster	0
ooh TAROM :)	0
always have been curious about them	0
We have had three jabs of Pfizer	0
they are supposed to be fancy	0
does TAROM still exist? :)	0
yes, very much so	0
they seem to be doing kinda bad	0
i mean, their prices are low these days	0
they didnt use to be	0
i think i might have to get a rain check on that CV	0
cant find it anywhere	0
i need to email my HR to see if they have it	0
but a colleague might have it	0
it might just not include my DELL and current job	0
so be wary of that	0
other than that, it should be accurate	0
whether you believe me that i worked at dell and where i currently am, i guess thats a question of trust more than if it was written on the CV	0
no rush	0
I do believe you	0
It's not to vett you, just to get an idea of what you do	0
I haven't really had any professional software jobs except for the project I was just on	0
I am trying to become more of a software developer and less of a hacker	0
you can never really separate the two	0
once a hacker, always a hacker	0
haha	0
you just get better at hiding it	0
and the code gets better	0

i'm going to have one more smoke and go to bed, so in about 10 minutes from now i am off	0
the long weekend is over	0
oh I forgot it's a holiday for you	0
it was	0
yeah	0
until about an hour ago	0
I will go to bed when you leave, then	0
long live romania and whatnot	0
I have to take my son to the dentist	0

My son was in here earlier today	0
nice	0
So he's officially the youngest person to come in this channel	0
at 20 months	0
oh, wow!	0
We just need an old person and then the generational chain will be complete	0
i hope you wont be teaching him to use Apple though	0
I am going to get him on a Pi soon	0
give him a lenovo and linux	0
I will start him on Linux	0
yes	0
nice	0
I won't tell him about Apple	0
I am going to leave Apple soon	0
I still have this machine from my job	0
their practices give me pause	0
I don't think they will ask for it	0
always have	0
Yeah, it's getting worse all the time	0
I can't upgrade it at all	0
I don't think anyone would want it	0
my family was never on apple	0
The keyboard already broke	0
????  ?????\_O< quack!	0
mainly because it was so expensive to get an iphone when i was small	0
I got on it when I started getting into foreign languages	0
.bef	0
orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 4.892 seconds! You have made friends with 75 ducks in #romanian.	0
The two reasons I got a Mac, back in 2005:	0
i think the iphone, when i was small, was three times my mom and dads salary combined	0
it was at that time one of the few options for a Unix with graphics that didn't need any kind of special setting up	0
that makes sense	0
and Macs are still superior for non-roman fonts	0
They are great for doing Sanskrit, Tibetan, Chinese, etc.	0
The situation has improved greatly since 2005	0
and I have also learned more,	0
so I can have all the major things on Ubuntu that I have on this Mac	0
my dad said, when i was small, that if he ever bought an iphone, he would chain it to the radiator	0
ha	0
My phone is Android	0
I would like to get from android as well	0
but there is much work to be done there as well	0
not ready at all, linux phones	0
I only started using smartphones a few years ago	0
I still do not use it for very much	0
I don't even have a permanent phone plan, just a pay-as-you-go service that I fill up	0
i use it, but hate how much information i share 	0
i know the kind	0
but now with my son, I think I will have to get a permanent plan	0
i am on a cool plan	0
I have to start being more responsible	0
the one you can only find in romania	0
When it was just me, it did not matter if I got lost in the woods or something	0
i pay like 3 euros a month for unlimited everything	0
libera?	0
digi	0
idk what libera is	0
My wife just got a plan with Libera, it sounds like the same kind of thing	0
They rent space on KPN's lines	0
the only thing i pay as-i-go is SMS, but i never use that anyway	0
It's just another company, I think they must be very small	0
I mainly just receive calls	0
When I am in the house I just have it connected to the house wi-fi	0
yeah, for calls and internet in EU space, i have unlimited	0
and the past 2 years I have not left the house much at all	0
but the speed is horrible in other countries, i dont know how you stand it	0
Just to get groceries from the supermarket down the street, which is literally 1 minute walk from my house	0
i order my groceries	0
We do that for Chinese food	0
i do it for everything	0
Some guy drives up in a white van and hands me stuff through the window	0
i have like amazon prime	0
well, not really	0
its the equivalent	0
for the romanian amazon	0
and delivery is free for anything	0
food, equipment, groceries	0
I shop at Albert Heijn for most foods and my wife gets special Chinese stuff from this Chinese online store	0
nice	0
We use Amazon for some things	0
I don't really like to use them	0
It's such an evil company	0
i dont like amazon either	0
I also order electronics from aliexpress	0
plus, everything i order, takes like 3 weeks from germany	0
technically we dont have amazon yet	0
I imagine there are probably Uyghur slaves making the things I order	0
so i order from amazon.de	0
Yeah, I think we also use Amazon.de	0
but other than that eMag has same day shipment for most stuff	0
There is an Amazon.nl but I think it does not have as many products	0
even if there was amazon here, i would say no thank you	0
one of the more horrible companies	0
eMag is bad too, they have monopolistic tendencies	0
but anyway, thats our time	0
ha	0
nice chatting with you	0
you too	0
have a good night	0
I'll be on tomorrow,	0
good night, see you later	0
i swear to god, everytime i come here i type join romania	0

hi orangeFlu 	0
just got back from the dentist	0
is it you? or your son?	0
it's me	0
but the dentist was for my son	0
me, meaning you, or the son of handyc	0
how was it?	0
uneventful, i hope	0
they said everything looked great	0
yes	0
first time	0
nice	0
i still have some milk teeth actually	0
they basically just said, "yes, he has teeth"	0
never fallen off	0
oh wow	0
that's weird	0
yes, i have very late denture? idk how its called	0
danture	0
I am not sure	0
dentures are what we call those fake teeth for old people	0
funny thing is, if they fall off, i dont know if there are new ones to take their place	0
delayed eruption	0
well, there has to be a word for teeth as a whole	0
lets go with that	0
well delayed eruption would mean the first teeth were late in coming	0
I am asking Google	0
well, the first ones started to fall when i was in 6th grade or something	0
so a bit late	0
and after a few, they just.. stopped	0
so i have around 10 left or something	0
that never fell	0
weird	0
but doesnt affect me day to day	0
also, there are weird people at my door doing stuff	0
i think they are working at the router for my floor	0
but not sure	0
i thought they were trying to break in at some point	0
i have my knife besides me just in case	0

great, orangeFl1 	0
oh that's fantastic, handyc 	0
yes, good oral hygiene is important	0
ok, whoever it was, left	0
i think i am  just paranoid	0
lets be real	0
there is no reason SRI has anything to do with me	0
right?	0
i will assume i am right	0
I think you are right on that, yes	0
They probably don't have time to investigate everyone thoroughly	0
probably	0
i dont know their budget	0
but i keep thinking about what that guy said	0
about SRI keeping an eye on him and who he hangs out with	0
its all either a big coincidence	0
plus, i live right next to a military base, something about "institul ed informatica militar" or something like that	0
Well, think about it this way	0
i've never been the paranois type, but damn	0
Would you expect them to tell potential candidates not to worry about what they do?	0
potential candidates?	0
Just because they say they watch everyone so closely, doesn't mean they have the resources or even the intention to do so	0
It's much easier to put the thought in people's minds that they are everywhere than to actually be everywhere	0
the intention, i think they do, the resources i have doubts	0
that is true	0
what potential candidates though?	0
Isn't your friend applying for a job with them?	0
or he is already in?	0
he is already in SPP	0
oh, okay	0
but the point stands anyway	0
the organization responsible for protecting the president and important politicians	0
he went through a special program for it, he is the engineer responsible for bombs and defusing them	0
i'm guessing since he already works with them, they must keep an eye on him	0
he is not really SRI, but it's SRI's job to do that, i reckon	0
he said he got some courses  onespionage and how to navigate through possible situations and all	0
i dont think he would lie about that	0
but who knows, fact is, i havent seen him in 6 years	0
i mean, i dont trust him completely is what i am trying to say	0
anyway, its good practice to try to stay private in relation to the government, no matter if its true or not what he said to me	0
thats why all this tech is here and configured by me to keep me private as possible	0
as private as possible*	0
yes, I agree, good to avoid giving out too much information in general	0

idk i think marvel went too far	0
kinda, me too. the cinema quality was kinda bad where i've seen it	0
in what way?	0
What was so good about it?	0
too much fan service? it was cool but this super hero thing feels so saturated now	0
the superhero thing does feel saturated	0
but the fan service was occasional and ok for me	0
needless to say, i still enjoyed them	0
occasional? isn't this whole movie just fan service :P	0
the story was very entertaining	0
i do too but the movie was made just for this	0
no	0
why would doctor strange be sooo darn stupid	0
to listen to that kid	0
it is the second best movie for me since infinity war	0
and then screw it up so badly	0
that did'nt make sense to me	0
because he was no longer the sorcerer supreme and was feeling useless	0
he wanted to do something	0
I liked some of the X-Men movies back in the 90s	0
I think most of the new Marvel movies are really stupid	0
yeah, those were fine	0
are those movies from the 90's?	0
some are, most make for good movies	0
What is the new Spiderman movie about?	0
but you are not their target audience, and technically, neither am i anymore	0
its kinda hard to explain	0
I find that most of the new movies are mostly eye candy with no plot	0
marvel movies these days are more like episodes of a show	0
spiderman has his identity revealed, he wants to erase everyone's memory with doctor strange help, but it goes wrong because he doesn't stop talking and... multiverse	0
What is the show about?	0
Thanks mattf	0
tom holland's peter parker is the villain on this movie :P	0
to really get the plot, you need to understand the whole flow of cause and effect that lead to this	0
i mean he is the cause of all problems	0
past tense of "to lead" is "led"	0
his whole problem is that his friends got hurt because of him and he wants to fix things	0
by almost causing the end of the multiverse	0
why are you being so cynical	0
well, no	0
did you watch the movie?	0
yeah	0
I liked the movie, i would watch it again	0
im just saying the plot seems shallow 	0
the spell doctor strange used, how was peter supposed to know it would have those side effects?	0
for all he knows, it is just a memory erasing thingy	0
and strange said they did use it for less	0
doctor strange shouldn't do that to begin with	0
for him, the stakes seemed non existent	0
he shouldnt	0
you are right	0
but you can see clearly why he did it	0
nor really	0
hes should be a smart guy if he can cause the collapse of the multiverse	0
he cared for peter, they were together in the whole thanos thing, and he wanted to feel useful since he wasntthe sorcerer supreme anymore	0
he was not causing the end of the multiverse though	0
at worst, ust his universe	0
just	0
which is bad enough	0
and he shouldnt have done it	0
but he did	0
yeah i find that too shallow	0
for the aforementioned reasons	0
of course you find it too shallow if you believe something a priori, i cant change your mind now	0
but doctor strange is shaallow	0
i think thats been established	0
nah his first movie was not	0
but he is a person is shallow	0
he wasn't that stupid on the endgame movies	0
he sacrificed stark to save the universe	0
again, he wasnt "stupid"	0
he saw his death on the first movie, so he is the type that would sacrifice tony stark to save half of this universe	0
but he wouldnt sacrifice stupid spiderman ???	0
what?	0
there was never any mention of sacrificing spiderman	0
by not doing what he asked	0
he wanted to help him because *i said before why*, realized he made a mistake and tried to fix it, but peter overpowered him	0
how does that not make sense	0
you don't seem to get my point, on the thanos movies strange so the only way to beat thanos with the time stone was by sacrificing stark right?	0
i mean, the sentence doesnt make much sense, but yes	0
stark is one of the smartest est guy in the earth that even figured out time travel! and he sacrificed him for the greater good of half of the universe not dying! Thats who stranger is, because compared to half of the universe dying, sacrificing stark is ok	0
ok, yeah	0
the come to him this brat that his biggest problem is he and his friends can't get on the university, and he is willing to do such a dangerous spell?	0
?????  ????\_?< quack!	0
.bef	0
orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 3.424 seconds! You have made friends with 77 ducks in #romanian.	0
he shouldn't have even cared about him	0
there are bigger problems on the universe	0
or something	0
it was weird	0
it was a stretch to make the movie go faster	0
if strange had just mentioned it and then later something developed with nedd finding his magical powers and trying that and screwing it all up would have made more sense	0
is not even that doctor strange is a spoiled magician now, but the fact that peter being too talkative broke it all is pretty... shallow	0
so it feels like the movie is just hurrying to come with the fanservice	0
think bigger, he ruined their lives, not just getting into MIT. Strange had a relationship with peter, he is no longer sorcerer supreme so he has resentment towards Wong to some degree, and wants to help Peter. The original spell is quite simple, as he states multiple times. This is Strange's mistake, he let himself driven by feeling rather than rationale. Then, Peter starts redoing the spell again 	0
and again. Strange, in his arrogance, believes he can do it, until he realizes he cannot. He contains the spell in that box thingy and wants to fix everything right then and there. Now comes his rationale in the play, realizing he made a mistake. Then Peter overpowers him and the movie plays along with Strange being caught in the mirror dimension and peter fucks it all up	0
this is not thinking bigger	0
i was referring to the "this brat and his biggest problem is..."	0
after what strange did in the infinity war he should not let himself be driven by feeling	0
the problem was bigger than getting into uni	0
he is a differet man	0
lots of time has passed since then	0
a lot of things happened	0
hahah ok then, be happy	0
in general, Strange is driven by feeling. But he then corrects	0
All the time	0
I would say this is in character for him	0
In infinity war, didnt he not even want to help stark in the first place because he didnt like him? And only then when he saw the future he realized what he had to do	0
choosing between stark and the half of the life of the universe? 	0
it annoys me you say the plot doesnt make sense and then proceed to downplay their problems and the fact that they are humans and do stupid shit sometimes because they are under pressure	0
no	0
before he knew what was at stake	0
but stranger wasn't under pressure	0
You mean he was content sitting and doing nothing?	0
i think it was too hurried up. If there was a movie were peter saved stranger's life or something like that before, it would make more sense	0
yeah, it was called endgame and infinity war	0
they worked together and saved each other	0
versus thanos	0
they had a bond	0
nah....	0
and the way everything is screwed up just because he keeps talking... 	0
handyc: you see what i'm dealing with here?	0
it could be better developed	0
again, it isnt because he kept talking	0
What are you dealing with, orangeFlu?	0
the early marvel movies like the first avenger, iron man, etc, had better excuses	0
not just that, anyway	0
this one feels more it is for kids	0
those were not as good	0
You seem to take it personally when someone doesn't like a film that you like	0
yes he does hahahaa	0
and it is not even that i didn't like it	0
I agree with mattf	0
I even watch to watch it again	0
The new Marvel movies seem really lazy to me	0
They rely on CGI for everything	0
There's never any real story	0
i dont take it personally, he just complains about the actual good parts of the movies, the parts that made sense and were very well thought out	0
thats quite a stretch now handyc	0
Watch Waiting for Godot	0
handyc: to be fair, you did say Dune was boring...	0
yeah	0
No, I said the new Dune is boring	0
The older one is great	0
its the only dune	0
The old one is shit	0
Okay, can you back that up with anything except emotion?	0
but the best dune is called star wars	0
Otherwise you don't even know how to talk about films	0
I asked you what the plot of the new Spiderman movie is, and you said it's complicated	0
You can say that about anything	0
The Mah?bh?rata is complicated	0
the plot feels like a big excuse to hurry up and bring fan service	0
because they saw "spider man into the spider verse" animation went very well	0
and thats a really good movie btw	0
The old one had underdeveloped characters, no real world building besides details splashed here and there, and the whole movie is basically a lot of action cramped into i cant remember how many minutes. there is no motivation for the characters, the geopolitical reasons for why they do the things they do is almost not there at all	0
thats what i think about that	0
its not in the spirit of the book	0
The new dune is a testament to how you turn a book into a good movie	0
take things slow, build up, explain without making the audience feel stupid	0
guys	0
there is a dune from 1984	0
and anothr from 1965	0
what?	0
!!!	0
dont know bout the 1965 one	0
oh no	0
i read it wrong	0
1965 is the book	0
ok then	0
1971 they started trying to make the movie	0
1977 star wars came and was a success	0
i mean, even the director of the old dune said he regretted making that movie	0
on the original movie they would have lightsabers and pink floyd would do the musical track	0
then they gave up on that	0
star wars was fucking great.. until the last movies	0
star wars came and was a success !	0
Empire Strikes Back is the best Star Wars	0
i liked the first one, the second one i hated with passion and the third one is just okay	0
they saw they lost the opportunity and rushed for the 1984 dune	0
Which one is the "first" Star Wars to you?	0
episode 1 or 4	0
i am talking first, second ... in the last trilogy	0
Those are all terrible	0
the first 3 are masterpieces	0
last trilogy is pretty bad	0
the next are 3 weree good	0
the mandalorian series is great though!	0
I have to help my son go to sleep in a little while	0
I mean now	0
I will be back in a bit	0
guys, i am agreeing with you	0
i didnt like the last trilogy at all	0
yeah	0
i think they shat on the whole idea	0
the mandalorian was so good. Especially the second season	0
yes with that end!	0
that was like the old star wars	0
yeeees	0
that series is better than those last movies	0
by far	0
true	0
the first season of mandalorian did feel like it was made for teenagers, the second was more adult	0
but still better than the last trilogy	0
idk how to call it	0
the shit trilogy	0
ST	0
yeah the disney trilogy	0
SDT'	0
Princess Lea is a disney princess now	0
thats where things started to go wrong	0
there were cool parts still	0
the new dune was the best movie of last year to me	0
STD's	0

orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 553.332 seconds! You have made friends with 78 ducks in #romanian.	0
someone on the romanian subreddit just suggested we should privatize STB	0
jesus, it is a bloodbath	0
who the fuck is that stupid	0
gasconheart: 	0
also, the Alder Lake mobile CPUs look so so good	0
i wove them	0
handyc: you back yet?	0
man is dark souls a good game	0
yes, but Alder Lake? And the new mobile CPUs from AMD?	0
idk about that	0
do you want to know?	0
tell me	0
do I want to know?	0
maybe? I think it's interesting	0
I dont know really if you are interested in hardware stuff	0
a bit	0
i guess not, if i had to guess	0
Well, the most interesting part in my opinion, is the separation from Intel of cores into two categories	0
They will have efficiency cores and performance cores	0
Which I think is really interesting	0
Basically performance cores stay dormant most of the time	0
Efficiency have low consumption and speed, obviously, and basically browsers and stuff will use those	0
are those mobile cpus?	0
Yes	0
I am talking about the mobile Alder Lake	0
the desktop Alder Lake has those too	0
in case you were wondering	0
so there will be dedicated cores instead of varying the clock?	0
i mean not instead, they might still vary, but performance ones work on higher ranges	0
Anyway, when you game or do anything that needs performance, P cores will step up, while E cores take care of background small tasks that the OS needs. The nice part is that because of this separation, P cores can achieve much higher clock speeds	0
is that it?	0
kinda, yeah	0
does that make it cheaper?	0
5 GhZ and higher will soon become the norm	0
thats sick	0
well, it wont be more expensive for the top of the line	0
thats amd doing?	0
but for more efficiency oriented CPUs, yeah	0
like U series 	0
which is for ultrabooks and whatnot	0
thats Intel, what I just described	0
ah	0
AMd has gone in a different direction	0
which makes me really happy	0
alder lake is intel?	0
.w alder lake	0
(mattf) Alder Lake (microprocessor) :: Alder Lake is Intel's codename for the 12th generation of Intel Core processors based on a hybrid architecture utilizing Golden Cove high-performance cores and Gracemont power-efficient cores. It is... :: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alder_Lake_(microprocessor)	0
Alder Lake is the architecture	0
oh it is the i12	0
g12	0
12th gen, yeah	0
i was reading about stb	0
hi everybody	0
were you guys together...	0
my wife took over, my son was asking about her too much	0
she took over him, like a demon pocession	0
for AMD, they already had good efficiency and multicore performance anyway, so I think it doesnt make sense right now to split the cores like AMD does. What they seem to be focusing on is developing their APU to be better for gaming	0
like Intel does&	0
yeah, she is being a bit of a demon	0
sorry	0
What they are doing is basically putting a smaller version of their dedicated GPUs in the processor	0
ah i see	0
So you can game with an iGPU	0
yeah i heard amd's dont have an igpu	0
so far they've used the Vega architecture	0
so they might have in the future?	0
they do have	0
they had for quite some time	0
i dont know hwy everybody tells me they dont have a GPU	0
iGPU	0
idk i heard that 	0
its true, they still make processors that dont, but the era in which AMD didnt put iGPUs is long over	0
anyway, Vega architecture	0
really good arch, very performant, compared to Intel's Iris	0
they are miles ahead of Intel on that one	0
But now, Vega is gone	0
On their Zen3+ architecture (meaning 6000 and 7000 series processors), their iGPUs will have the RDNA2 arch	0
which is basically the same architecture that their dGPUs use	0
but it will be a scaled down version	0
and I have to say, since I have Vega, I am very impressed with what it can do in terms of graphics	0
I can play Minecraft with 60 fps on my Vega iGPU	0
Can you imagine what the RDNA 2 will do?	0
These people can't stop innovating	0
interesting	0
Only time i used an amd was on my granny's computer	0
a cpu, no idea what model was	0
probably Athlon	0
those were shit compared to what Intel was doing	0
it has a high clock and was cheaper	0
like 3.8 ghz	0
Clock doesnt really matter that much these days. I mean, it does, but in combination with many more factors	0
yeah	0
like memory speed, IPC, vector instructions, arch type	0
number of cores	0
I can't use Vegan architecture	0
me neither	0
we never talked about that	0
are vegans stupid?	0
I'm not going to give up meat just to use a computer	0
A processor these days at 1 GHz can run circles around a processor at 5Ghz 5 years ago	0
or do they have a point	0
handyc: I agree	0
mattf, here is the truth about Vegans	0
It's not that they don't like meat,	0
the reason they don't eat it is that Vega is 25 light years from Earth and the meat would go bad on their journey	0
so they just get annoyed with people talking about it	0
i see	0
??  ???????\_?< QUACK!	0
You shouldnt eat meat if you dont have the strength of character to raise animals and then kill them	0
.bef	0
they could freeze it	0
(orangeFlu) Who knew ducks could be so picky? You can try again in 7 seconds.	0
.bef	0
mattf you befriended a duck in 9.348 seconds! You have made friends with 403 ducks in #romanian.	0
Yes, I agree, orangeFlu 	0
I do have the strength of character to do that	0
I just don't have the resources	0
Yeah, me too	0
I used to kill chickens and one time a pig when i was little	0
I dont have a countryside house anymore though	0
I try to buy meat that isn't industry farmed, though	0
I think factory farming is immoral, but I don't think eating animals is wrong	0
Well, yeah, i think 90% of people agree	0
i cant find not ins=dustry farmed meat though	0
handyc: twint -s vegan	0
my choices regarding meat are pretty limited here actually	0
anyway, did i tell you guys the big news?	0
you finally got out of the closet?	0
yes, i am gay now	0
but no	0
thats small news	0
wow	0
handyc: i need encouragement	0
i am dropping out of my uni and started the enrollment process for the Danish Institute of Technology	0
I would very much like to move there	0
With my grades from highschool and whatnot, i am 95% sure i will be accepted	0
well I think if you became gay you probably have to go to a special university for gay people	0
yeah	0
GIT	0
well, thats not what i meant by encouragement but it works	0
hahaha	0
orangeFlu what kind of help do you really need	0
I can help you edit the documents	0
I am good at that	0
My aunt and uncle run a small farm in Iowa	0
I dont need help per say, I just need one person to tell me they think I am doing the right thing by going after my passion and not staying in a country I amstarting to hate, at a uni that pulls me down	0
It's not really a commercial farm, though, it's more like they do it for fun	0
even if i wasted a few years with this uni	0
orangeFlu, go for it	0
I want to feel like I am doing a mistake	0
am not*	0
fuck sake	0
Freudian Slip	0
Denmark is a great country	0
I had a classmate who went there for a postdoc	0
I have lived in several different countries	0
My parents told me I was being a big dummy for moving away from Illinois	0
well and they were right	0
In what way?	0
Every time I go back to my hometown, the only people still around that I know are losers who couldn't do anything with their lives	0
You have to leave home to really make something of yourself	0
You can always go back later and show everybody what you did	0
Otherwise you're too comfortable with familiarity	0
I love the way things are done in the west. Things like choosing what subjects you want to take, this emphasis on coming up with original ideas and studying what you actually like. I dont like signing up for a uni, only to realise that i need to take 20 compulsory subjects, 18 of which i havent the slightest will to learn, no do they interest me, because they told me in the beginning i will be 	0
learning a lot of programming, and they lied anyway	0
i hate it, i hate it, i hate it	0
it seems very predatory, what they did	0
orangeFlu, I think it would be a wonderful experience for you	0
I can't think of a reason *not* to do it	0
cant choose any subjects. The only choice I got at my 'CS uni' is between sports and philosophy	0
I am trying to convince mattf to come to Europe	0
thank you, handyc 	0
that what i needed to hear	0
That's unimaginable to me -- in the US you can choose anything you like	0
I had 3 majors at one time	0
mattf: come to europe you beautiful bastard	0
I almost got three bachelor's degrees	0
yeah I want to	0
i never understood what is a major	0
The thing you focus on	0
So if you are studying computer science, that is your major, and you get a degree in that	0
yeah, well here you choose it when you choose the uni basically	0
and you can get a minor also	0
So I took a mathematics minor	0
You don't get a degree for the minor but you can list it on your CV,	0
and then people know, okay, he know Computer Science as his main focus and he also knows Sports Medicine or whatever	0
Yeah in the US it's practically the opposite	0
we dont have minors here, everybody from a given faculty studies the exact same things. You see the problem here? There is absolutely no flexibility. Oh, you wanna move to a different faculty because you realized this one was not right for you? Tough luck, the proffesors you currently have dont accept your transfer. You are stuck	0
They let you into the university and you declare a major, but you can basically switch to anything you like once you are in	0
Yes, seems very rigid to me	0
that would be aweome	0
In the US we had tons of electives	0
The US system stresses a well rounded education	0
i can assume what they are	0
arethey like optional stuff?	0
we had those as well, they were called "facultative", and you needed to pay for them. They were shit anyway, you didnt learn anything and the only thing you did was crowd your schedule with one more exam	0
did you go again? handyc 	0
mattf: when i have the money, i will invite you to stay with me	0
handyc does that	0
i have this bucketlist since i was little	0
What i need is a job	0
im trying to get my dream remote job	0
and the number one thing is: "rescue hairy clever man from the depths of brazil"	0
im not that hairy	0
i've grown quite attached to you in a non gay way	0
you are pretty gay	0
shut up	0
half gay	0
the best way to get a job is to come here	0
have someone take you in for a bit	0
till you can get a job	0
shameful	0
did i tell you about the guy i stayed at in denmark?	0
no	0
a 22 year old from argentina	0
he sold his car, saved about 10 thousand euros and moved there	0
and he made it	0
he had a very nice apartment and friends	0
honestly, not that much different from you	0
what does he work on there	0
the only difference	0
and denmark allows anyone to stay there forever?	0
you are much more clever than him	0
this is no worries for me though, i have someone i can marry with in germany! if everything goes right	0
:P	0
if you work, i believe so, at least if you are from europe. I think you need something like a work visa thing to stay forever, but i think its not tha complicated	0
oh yeah thats true	0
i mean, that guy did it, and he was working as a delivery man	0
your chances are much higher	0
can be	0
i wouldn't be very sure just yet	0
ask handy since he is also a foreigner	0
what was his experience	0
i did	0
and?	0
i mean i want to go to europe	0
i actually dont know how it is for non europeans	0
I dont need a visa or anything really, i can just decide to stay there	0
i believe i have an aunt that is taking drugs to europe	0
well, then, if you save enough money, what is really keeping you?	0
my parents, covid	0
covid is not an excuse	0
ofc it is	0
are you vaccinated and everything?	0
2 doses	0
take your 3rd	0
and then no excuses	0
in 1 month or so	0
the story is i finished uni, covid started and we moved back to the farm	0
why do you feel that your parents are a reason to stay there?	0
and i have lupita and my cats now too	0
well yeah i dont want to just run away from them with them telling me not to go :p	0
you could have a life in a much better country	0
yeah	0
well, tough shit	0
no parent wants their kid to just leave	0
exactly	0
and its hard to hear this	0
but	0
you need to be selfish right now	0
yeah	0
rise above your condition	0
believe me	0
i would even take you in my apartment if i could	0
no please haha	0
I mean, i technically can	0
wanna come?	0
and we go to denmakr together	0
someday	0
hairy bastard	0
i say this affectionately	0
i dont know how it is there, but here the culture amongst male teenagers is to support each other. And yes, I kissed a few guys but I dont know men my age that didnt at least once. We are very open to each other here. Thats why you think I am gay 	0
This is jsut the norm in my group of friends	0
i dont really think you are gay	0
it was a joke	0
really? i thought you did	0
i never kissed a guy though and that would be pretty weird to say here :P	0
I did, like 3 or 4	0
hi guys	0
sorry, I had to take care of my demon wife	0
that was fast	0
read what i said, like the last 20 lines	0
and join the discussion	0
i am really curious to hear your thoughts	0
orangeFlu, you have the advantage over me, being from Europe	0
is Romanian a Schengen country?	0
no	0
oh	0
but i dont need a visa	0
i just show my id	0
and they let me in	0
okay, cool	0
I had to start my own business just to retain permission to live here	0
but it actually wasn't very difficult	0
The Netherlands is a great country for immigrants	0
okay I am reading the log	0
i think most in europe are, at least the west	0
?  ????????\_O< QUACK!	0
.bef	0
mattf you befriended a duck in 4.441 seconds! You have made friends with 404 ducks in #romanian.	0
well as far as the affection thing goes, I think it's unfortunate that so many men have such anxiety about their sexuality that they can't express love toward anybody	0
people that moved in germany or sweden from romania told me they just.. moved there? and that was it. They found work, rented a place and that is that	0
We have that kind of gay fearing culture in the US as well	0
yes, exactly	0
When I was a kid, I enjoyed cooking with my mom,	0
and even doing that, people said I was gay,	0
you do? in the movies, people seem really accepting	0
im not afraid of gays, im a homophobe 	0
(afraid of humans)	0
mattf: ???	0
and it made me uncomfortable enough that I stopped learning how to cook	0
ah, cool	0
and I really regret that	0
:P	0
i'm sorry to hear that	0
It's okay, I've been getting back into cooking lately	0
Other things that my older brother told me were gay: trying to do oil painting, appreciating classical music	0
reading literature	0
But I don't let people bother me with stupid opinions like that now	0
i've frenched one guy, the others just kissed, and i have a friend with which we always touch each others innapropriately just for a laugh. It's not sexual or anything, we just enjoy that level of intimacy	0
Well, you know that I study social rituals	0
and i am very grateful i was raised that way	0
well i find that disgusting	0
Like I told you yesterday, there's no standard for these kinds of things	0
It's okay, mattf, you don't have to join in	0
mattf: why?	0
i dont know why	0
i wont ask you to kiss me :))	0
i respect boundaries	0
i dont care what do you do or even if you are gay, but i wouldn't be comfortable on having to watch two man kiss	0
those are thins we discussed a priori and stated that it's okay	0
while im fine with two girls kissing	0
males are disgusting	0
What if it was two girls, and then you found out they had dicks	0
if they look like girls i can stand to watch	0
what i am disgusted about is when two muscular black males start hugging and kissing	0
ha	0
they dont need to be black :P	0
interesting	0
thug hugs	0
i dont see anyone anyway	0
i think, if you live in a place where that kind of thing is accepted, you will change your opinion	0
I told mattf I would help him buy time with a prostitute in Amsterdam	0
He didn't believe me about the windows	0
Hahaha	0
i do believe	0
Yes, it's true	0
It's like a toy store with Barbie dolls	0
They are behind glass like a product, it's unreal	0
i find whores disgusting too	0
It's kinda wrong, seems to objectifying for me to be honest. But if they are there on their own free will, i dont have a problem with it	0
it just, you can nver be sure	0
I would probably have a difficult time paying for sex and getting enjoyment out of it, I think, but I don't have a problem with other people doing that	0
Modern dating is mostly objectification anyway	0
thats their freedom	0
This just cuts out some of the rituals	0
i never payed for sex either, but i am curious about the prospect, i will probably try it just out of curiosity	0
i think i would never do this	0
My wife and I walked around the red light district when we first got here	0
mattf: thats what i'm saying, i sometimes worry that they are somehow forced to objectify themselves, and that makes me unconfortable	0
She was curious to see it also	0
That's also where all the good Chinese food is	0
coincidence? i think not	0
The Amsterdam Chinatown is in the Red Light District	0
you can eat some chineses there?	0
i hope not	0
The working women are generally white	0
But the Chinese restaurants are staffed by real Chinese people and have many Chinese customers, very authentic	0
If you like spicy food, we can go to my favorite Sichuan restaurant sometime	0
i love spicy food	0
I am not sure what the restaurant situation will be like in March because of Covid	0
but if it's safe enough we can try to go to Fulu in Amsterdam	0
It's right next to the old city hall, which was also used as a palace for a brief time by Napoleon's brother	0
nice	0
i would like to try some chinese food	0
Yeah, if that is open for tours, it's worth seeing	0
Well my wife also cooks amazing food	0
Here, I dont like it	0
She can cook better than most of the Chinese restaurants here	0
Nice	0
As far as the jobs thing goes, I am not sure how it is for most people since my professional background is so weird,	0
but there are a lot of tech jobs here	0
especially in The Hague	0
Please understand i have no expectation of you to cook something for me or anything. Nor do I want to waste your time if you are busy. Just tell me if you are. I only want to visit you for a bit to meet you	0
You won't be wasting my time	0
I wouldn't invite you if I didn't mean it	0
And it would be rude not to cook a meal for you	0
I dont see it that way	0
I won't cook, my wife will	0
Well, she's Chinese, that's how Chinese people operate	0
I will not be offended if you dont	0
Especially Cantonese people,	0
they show affection through food	0
But you will also want to see other things on your own, I think	0
You can stop by for as long as you like	0
Ok, I respect her tradition then, if she wants to cook	0
The only real concern I have is the virus	0
I have enough time to visit, i will be there for almost a week	0
My wife and I are both working from home, so we don't really have firm deadlines	0
Her schedule is tighter than mine because she does actual work at the moment	0
but she doesn't have to show up somewhere at 9:00 am or something	0
She just takes translation projects and completes them by a deadline	0
??????  ???\_?< FLAP FLAP!	0
Ok, so what do we do about the virus? Of course, wearing a mask is a given, dont worry about that	0

Well, if you are vaccinated, I'm not sure you even need to wear a mask	0
I'm more worried about going out in public and doing stuff	0
For that I do wear a mask	0
I am not really sure what to do about it	0
vaccinated people can still get it and transfer to non vaccinated ?	0
Many people in my neighborhood do not wear a mask and are not vaccinated at all	0
The Muslim community and the Polish community in particular,	0

I have noticed they tend to be very anti-vaxx	0
its always the polish	0
and our neighborhood has a lot of Polish people and Muslim people	0
We live in a section of town that is not especially rich	0
It's still a safe neighborhood but it has a lot of immigrants	0
I don't really understand this about Polish people, because I had thought they had a rich history of science	0

i heard the same about german	0

loudercake you befriended a duck in 64.856 seconds! You have made friends with 66 ducks in #romanian.	0
 well, no, TPM is something a little bit different	0
handyc: 	0
TPM is the generic names for chips outside of the cpu containing keys for encryption/decryption	0
Pluton will have the same purpose of a TPM, with some major differences	0
It will run Microsoft's firmware, not the motherboard's	0
And so microsoft has complete control over it and what it can hold	0
It will be essentially a black box, because you cant know whats inside a TPM	0
Even if you could, since this one is in the CPU... you are gonna have to destroy the CPU	0
it cant be removed	0
And who's to say it only does TPM things? What is stopping microsoft for making a backdoor through it?	0
I don't like how it sounds, and I don't trust Microsoft to be in charge of such a essential piece of hardware	0
I'm curious to see what they do with it and if it's possible to restrict certain software/os based on it	0
Don't you see a future in which microsoft blocks installing anything on that computerif certain time passes, basically planning obsolesence?	0

I see there were many quits today	0
I see you abused ofnken today loudercake	0
I'm still on my bed and my pets are over me	0
something like that	0
they are quite relentless	0
for making a TMP a requirement for windows 11	0
and then releasing pluton	0
it almost seems like it wasnt an accident	0
their motivation is that a separate chip on the motherboard can still be hacked if you have physical access to the machine	0
But you know what they say	0
Physical access is root access	0
Yeah that's pretty shitty of am idea isn't it....	0
I dont think Pluton can help you in any way if someone has your machine	0
Encrypting your disk might be better	0
Plus, i cant shake the feeling that it is one of those things that are a minor annoyance for actual hackers to bypass anyway, and a major annoyance for regular consumers	0
like DRM	0
Yeah i see	0
yes, encrypt your disk people	0
I think their point is to control on what machine you can install windows in. So pluto is only compatible with the newest. Kinda like what happened with tpm	0
yeah	0
plus, if they put a backdoor in there for NSA or whoever else to use, why not?	0
The factories might be paying for this	0
The CCCP wll be very happy for this	0
Yeah yeah	0
Never guessed windows would become more annoying	0
loudercake how are we doing ... ???	0
im gonna start 10	0
Awesome!	0
There was some trick on 10 or 11. Disabling the Area2D shape for the sword from the editor didn't work and it was active on the beginning of the game. I has to do it on the players '_ready' function like: $Area2D.Shape.disabled = true	0
You will be implementing animating and attacking leaves	0
oh area2Ds are for hitboxes?	0
Yes	0
or triggers in general?	0
i guess both	0
Aread2D can detect whenever another area or body enters and exits it	0
So you can use it for many things	0
sounds useful	0
Triggers in general yeah.	0
And you can animate it to only activate during the attack animation at the position you want and then deactivate it.	0
So it becomes a hitbox	0

oh, I see what you mean about the TPM, orangeFlu 	0
yes, indeed that is a scary future	0
but the future is always scary in some ways	0
yes, it is	0
every black mirror episode gives me anxiety about future tech and what it can do	0
even if the episode is cheery, i shit my pants because you can see what it will be actually used for	0
but 100 years ago, imagining the world we have now would have been terrifying to many people	0
it should be terrifying to use now as well	0
ha	0
it's good to be concerned about those kinds of security developments and the bad things they can be used for	0
hackers? technology that if broken and attacked in the right way can cause death, injury of many people, not to mention a probably economic collapse	0
but at the end of the day, this is the world and you have to live in this world	0
what people dont seem to get is how fragile everything really is	0
You can protest against certain things and maybe make some progress, but there are also some inevitabilities	0
i dont protest tech	0
Okay	0
Some people do	0
i thibk it's done wonderful things for us, more so than if we wouldnt have had it	0
that isnt a debate	0
I read this interesting article about Agatha Christie this morning	0
can you please rewrite for me the first sentence?	0
with the right tenses and all	0
The article was talking about how in 1913 Agatha Christie could afford to employ a live-in maid and a nanny for her child	0
orangeFlu: awesome? are you watching this boba fett thing?	0
but could not afford a car	0
"i thibk it's done wonderful things for us, more so than if we wouldnt have had it"	0
interesting	0
mattf: i started the first ep a few minutes ago	0
and she did not consider herself rich	0
orangeFlu: ah ok	0
handyc: its very hard to point out a threshold for when you become rich	0
My wife and I like to take tours of old palaces	0
since that threshold also changes everyday	0
We have been to the homes of kings in many different countries	0
We saw the palace of Kamehameha in Hawaii	0
We went to the Summer Palace in China	0
We went to the palace of Napoleon's brother in Amsterdam	0
My wife has been to the White House but I have never been there, would like to see it sometime	0
every american needs to	0
We have also been to a number of those historic houses where they preserve everything	0
also, the sentence, please?	0
In my hometown, the house of Abraham Lincoln is preserved as it would have been when he was alive	0
along with the entire street, and people dress in period costumes	0
like Stalin's childhood home	0
i want to see that	0
The interesting thing about all these places is the opulence	0
Of course, that's why people go and see them	0
But also, they almost never have a toilet	0
At least not the kind we would imagine, with running water	0
It always reminds me how lucky I am to have been born into this world	0
I have a toilet and a TV, and the emperor of China never had those things	0
i sometimes think about that as well	0
handyc: the sentence, please	0
Which sentence?	0
"i thibk it's done wonderful things for us, more so than if we wouldnt have had it"	0
can you correct it with the right tense and stuff, please?	0
I think it's done wonderful things for us -- moreso than if we hadn't had those things.	0
interesting	0
There is no single correct way to say that, though	0
i am trying to remember all the rules you need to follow for if clauses, and my brain explodes	0
The biggest thing that stood out to me was 'thibk'	0
small typo	0
orangeFlu, try not to overthibk	0
i was worried about the tense in the second part of the sentence	0
I know many people who try to follow all the rules and do not sound like natural speakers	0
here is an interesting one that gasconheart will also appreciate	0
i need to take an english exam soon	0
When you arrive somewhere, in English, should you say, "It is I" or "It is me"?	0
doesnt matter what natural speakers sound like, it matters that i need to follow the rules to get at least a B2	0
It is me	0
me is the object	0
accusative form	0
Yes, but that's not grammatical	0
It is I! Mario!	0
It should be "It is I" like Dracula would say	0
Why?	0
But I would actually say "It's me"	0
ok, but still, i need to take the Cambridge test and get a B2 or more	0
https://painintheenglish.com/case/642	0
Title: "It is I" vs. "It is me"	0
The verb "to be" is often an outlier in many languages	0
because i need to be able to apply to uni and  i need that	0
Weird conjugations and weird usages	0
it's always an outlier, so is to do	0
to have	0
sorry	0
But if everyone says "It's me", then how can we say that "It is I" is the correct way?	0
Yes, be, have, do	0
Because these are used so often, I guess	0
do is only sometimes weird	0
Number words in other languages are also very weird	0
in romanian it is not	0
in german it is not	0
I have to go help with my son, sorry, I will be back in a little while	0
i love talking about numerals!	0
"number words" hehe	0
Billions are confusing	0
they always are	0
"it is me whom you see", "it is I who sees you"	0
what comes after millions in portuguese?	0
I think in Portuguese and english One billions is 1000000000	0
but in spanish is different	0
they have one thousand millions, correct if im wrong	0
so one billion would be 10^12 ?	0
one Spanish billion is 1.000.000.000.000	0
so portuguese uses the long scale?	0
of course billion is another word in spanish	0
mind the dots	0
yes 10^12	0
how weird is that!	0
thats one trillion to us	0
does spanish have one million billions too?	0
sure	0
gasconheart: whats one trillion in spanish?	0
10^18 ?	0
oh let me think	0
orangeFlu: so they call it long scale? I call it wrong scale	0
18 mattf yes	0
it does make sense to have one thousand millions and one million billions	0
why things suddenly change at one million?? Well but it does make the number names shorter	0
but it is confusing. It should be the same in spanish and portuguese	0
mattf: unrelated, are you doing something on the server?	0
no	0
I might log in and out but that i have automatically	0
i dont do nothing in weeks	0
something is werd	0
log in, htop	0
what do you see?	0
ok	0
i see it i staking long to log in	0
:P	0
staking	0
yep	0
i guess it will never log in	0
for me it did eventually	0
let me tell yu what i see	0
whats using most cpu	0
all processors to 100	0
and tens of ifconfigs	0
sort by cpu and see	0
and auditd	0
ifconfigs???	0
yes	0
thats weird	0
yes	0
some script that uses if ooooh wait	0
and now they stopped	0
:P	0
and now they go again	0
i do have a script that logins in every time and might run ifconfig, it is something i have to create a conky monitor of my remote machines...	0
wait ifconfig?	0
im not sure if i run ifconfig on that	0
no, they are made by root	0
not mattf'	0
some systems dont even have ifconfig	0
/sbin/init maybe-ubiquity	0
what is that?	0
that is spawning all those processes	0
ubiquity? isn't that a installer	0
installer for what?	0
.w ubiquity	0
(mattf) Ubiquity (software) :: Ubiquity is the default installer for Ubuntu and its derivatives. It is run from the Live CD or USB and can be triggered to run from the options on the device or on the desktop of the Live mode. It... :: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquity_(software)	0
a linux installer lol	0
what?	0
why	0
is 	0
it	0
running	0
why is init running it	0
is it doing a dist upgrade on its own?	0
dafuq	0
i mean if /sbin/init is running it 	0
 	0
AFAIK this param resides in the DEFAULT commandline after one has installed the system from a LiveCD/DVD image.	0
 	0
Ubiquity is an installer system Ubuntu uses on the live systems, there seems to be a bug that keeps this param also in the default commandline after installation.	0
 	0
I think it's safe to remove from GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT.	0
ok	0
it never did anything like this before	0
you have systemd right?	0
yes, i do	0
are you sure that is causing the cpu hog though	0
well, i see 40-50 ifconfigs	0
all running real time	0
do you have any crazy scripts on root's crontab?	0
spawned by auditd	0
that is spawned by ubiquity	0
how long you dont reboot?	0
my uptime is 1 day and 10 hours, if this was init's problem, i would have seen it yeserday as well	0
well try removing that ubiquity from grub	0
if it is there	0
i need to check login logs from root	0
do you have a quick one liner to list succesful root logins from ssh?	0
you shouldn't have login as root from ssh enabled to begin with	0
yea 	0
but	0
other than that	0
the oneliner?	0
isn't it 	0
last	0
doesnt show more than the last login, which was me	0
idk why	0
i am currently checking auth.log by hand	0
last shows a lot on my vps's	0
 	0
orangeFlu: sudo zgrep sshd /var/log/auth.log* | grep host | sed -re 's/.*rhost=([^ ]+).*/\1/' | sort -u	0
 	0
can you delete last hisotry?	0
yeah	0
       last searches back through the /var/log/wtmp file (or the file designated by the -f option) and displays a	0
       list of all users logged in (and out) since that file was created. One or more usernames and/or ttys can be	0
       given, in which case last will show only the entries matching those arguments. Names of ttys can be	0
       abbreviated, thus last 0 is the same as last tty0.	0
 	0
i cant find anything	0
but he couldnt get in	0
i have root ssh enabled, but its key based	0
it is usually not someone that invaded	0
then what the fuck prompted it to start blasting my server with those commands	0
just normal linux trouble 	0
i am upgrading it and rebooting	0
i need to implement some alert system	0
email	0
for high cpu usage?	0
for ssh login	0
yeah for root login makes sense	0
or maybe tty spawns?	0
see if anyone spawned an interactive shell	0
you will be then spammed by my monitor script :P	0
but i can disable it	0
what does your monitor script do again?	0
let me see	0
is this on version control even	0

you can check those files manually	0
i did	0

mattf you befriended a duck in 13.485 seconds! You have made friends with 408 ducks in #romanian.	0
orangeFlu: they are empty?	0
would be weird	0
they are not empty	0
well that is better	0
/var/log/lastlog has only one line though	0
root, 17:36, when i logged in	0
which is weird	0
you dont have something that wipes the logs do you	0
no	0
well anyway if the high cpu is due to ifconfig spam... it is just bug	0
i restarted it	0
will tell you if its ok	0
if not, will close it and keep it closed until i can figure it out	0
seems i cant login	0
i removed you from my monitor so it wont keep trying to login	0
its still restarting	0
i dont think it was your fault 	0
but still, weird	0
yeah	0
and when i have things like this happen, i get paranoid	0
i need to secure myself better	0
still, i would like to keep root ssh login enabled	0
why does he use rotation degree?	0
of the position2D node?	0
hes going to parent the colision shape to that	0
yes	0
and build some sort of an arm	0
it makes things easier	0
oh its to pivot	0
yes	0
you could keyframe the position and rotation of the area2D	0
but doing like that is a bit less values to mess up	0
yeah thats what i was doing by accident lol	0
his way is smarter 	0
thats why it is good to watch those tutorials and know those nodes exist and can be used like that	0
im just afraid that wjhen im left on my own i dont get lost	0
left on your own?	0
you wont be left on your own	0
oh yeah you	0
hah?	0
it is I!	0
great	0
btw im going to the pool on friday	0
you swim?	0
not really	0
but its been a while	0
but you do now how to swim	0
umm kinda	0
i had swimming lessons	0
i had too at that age	0
i like to play on the water	0
no like when i was 9 or 8	0
i could stay underwater for like 1,5 minutes at my best	0
i dont think i can stay 10 seconds right now	0

yeah	0
but hey water is fun	0
i tis	0
its	0

ok, back	0
hi orangeFlu 	0
hello	0
so where can i get the ciggies?	0
also, we were talking about numerals	0
when you left	0
yeah, numbers are great, orangeFlu 	0
Dutch numbers are strange to me	0
people say 22 like "two and twenty"	0
oh, thats normal	0
relative to how french people say numbers	0
thats my benchmark	0
it sounds old fashioned to my ear	0
if it's less weird than french, i say "its normal"	0
4 and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie	0
i guess, if you try to translate it to english, it does sound odd	0
so it is in german	0
zwei und zwanzig	0
it sounds old, like middle English to me	0
Many Dutch phrases sound very archaic to me	0
well, middle engish does have a lot in common with dutch and german, no?	0
yeah, it does	0
it's not really surprising, just interesting to hear it in daily modern usage	0
give me an example of a dutch phrase that sounds odd?	0
its not a question, moreso a request	0
let me think a moment	0
i am trying to learn ansible	0
oh yeah?	0
what is that for?	0
I have heard of it but I don't really know what it is	0
i need to reinstall my server in a few days, i want to try something else, and i need ansible to get it up and running first time, no fuss	0
its basically a way to "script" an installation	0
but in a way that is much less error prone and imdepotent	0
i think its the word	0
like bash?	0
no, bash is not imdepotent	0
and bash scripting, honestly, very much sucks	0
hahahaha	0
.wa imdepotent	0
bash has its uses	0
(orangeFlu) Definitions: 1 | adjective | lacking power or ability 2 | adjective | (of a male) unable to copulate - https://is.gd/FkFplF	0
no...	0
it does, but not as a scripting language	0
good for interactive comamnds	0
not so good for more complicated scripting	0
I don't know a word imdepotent	0
independent?	0
i would much rather use python or powershell	0
come on, i'm not that stupid	0
I didn't call you stupid	0
I don't know what you are trying to say	0
idempotent	0
.wa idempotent	0
(orangeFlu) Definition: An operator A^~ such that (A^~)^2 = A^~ or an element of an algebra x such that x^2 = x. - https://is.gd/YkVyvC	0
skip the math stuff	0
not a word I am familiar with	0
I had to look it up	0
it means you can do things twice with no consequences if the first time succeded	0
like, if i did mkdir folder	0
once, it would work	0
twice, it would error	0
because the folder is there already	0
get what i mean?	0
?  ????????\_?< FLAP FLAP!	0

(orangeFlu) The duck said no, maybe bribe it with some pizza? Ducks love pizza don't they? You can try again in 7 seconds.	0
mattf: i hate you	0
.bef	0
orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 16.977 seconds! You have made friends with 81 ducks in #romanian.	0
well, somehow ansible takes care of that	0
and you make tasks, sorta like functions, that you put into "playbooks"	0
which sounds dirty but isnt	0
and you can install a server through ssh with one line of code 	0
that line being executing the playbook	0
interesting word, thanks	0
you can do mkdir -p	0
but you dont have the same luxury with more complex commands	0
which can fail for many reasons	0
and again, managing all the possible error codes in a bash script is... bleah	0
why the hate on mattf	0
well, my main use for bash scripts is one-liners	0
I use them all the time	0
because of the supid duck pizza stuff thingy	0
mattf doesn't control the ducks	0
he coded that behaviour 	0
are you saying a programmer is not responsible for what his code does?	0
i'm kidding right now, of course	0
you still havent told me any dutch saying	0
He didn't write that duck program	0
everybody uses that bot	0
I will send you a Dutch saying 	0
4 people are talking to me all at once	0
thats ook	0

i have so much stuff i want to do, but time isnt on my hands	0
and i need to take that english exam	0
which i am very nervous about	0
I will send you a phrase tomorrow	0
ok	0
Don't be nervous, be confident	0
Your English is great	0
its mediocre at best	0
i regularly get stuff wrong	0
Get plenty of sleep	0
Eat almonds, eat some tuna	0
i just pray its at least a B2	0
almonds, tuna?	0
why	0
does it help with my accent?	0
brain food	0
You will get a B2, don't worry	0
we'll see	0
or better probably	0
Your English is fine, dude	0
i need the money to schedule an exam first	0
which should be coming on the 5th	0
I wouldn't even know you're not a native speaker 	0
my wife says we should do hot pot	0
then we can try all kinds of different things at once	0
this is cute but you know that's not true	0
we can do a spicy broth and a non spicy broth	0
ok, lets do a hot pot	0
I don't lie to people	0
what is a hot pot exactly?	0
spicy broth? that does sound interesting..	0
it's a big bot of boiling broth,	0
you throw vegetables and meats in,	0
then you fish them out and eat them	0
ah, i see	0
sounds cool, never ate something like that	0
it's a similar concept to fondue	0
never ate fondue either :))	0
yeah I figured that might be new to you	0
it's a good winter food	0
fondue is not worth the effort, but all Chinese people love hot po	0
hot pot	0
i cook mea all the time, nothing else. I am suprised i am even alive	0
meat	0
ha	0
you have to take care of yourself	0
yes, thats why i eat meat	0
today some pork, tomorrow some beef and then 4-5 days of chicken, repeat	0
you will get vitamin deficiencies that way	0
i cant find the time to cook something else because i want to program and do stuff and be productive	0
You can still be productive and cook healthful meals	0
and i would rather learn stuff and try to get into that dream university	0
You can get in	0
I can help you edit the applications	0
what i usually do is buy the meat, bathe it in a lot of condiments, leave it for some time, and come lunch, cook in the oven for 20-30 minutes	0
easy and quick	0
thank you	0
i need all the help i can get	0
I'm happy to help	0
I think your skills are way better than you imagine, though	0
i dont really care what my mom thinks, but she did say in the last few year or so i am kind of a disappointment because i am just like my father	0
my father dropped out of college too	0
for different reasons though	0
but i feel the need to prove her and myself i am not	0
thank you for everything	0
prove to her*	0
anyway, thats enough for today, i really need to sleep well	0
thank you and good night	0
i will leave irssi open	0
Get sleep	0
you will do great	0

i feel good without having smoked	0
that being said, i am going to the shops for a bit because i desperately need ciggies	0
be back in 10 or so minutes?	0
yes, adi	0
orangeFlu: I am a former smoker myself ;)	0
i have two tabs open	0
wait	0
one is orangeFlu and the other is orangeFl1	0
ok, done	0
now it is really I	0

it is so so rare	0
fuck you both, you should be ashamed to be called orangeFlu	0
orangeFlu, if you go long enough without them, then you won't need them anymore	0
what do you mean	0
you always crave them	0
always	0
how long have you gone without them	0
about 14-15 hours now	0
but i've arrived at the point when the laziness is trumped by the need to smoke, so i will go to the shops	0

Do you think it's impossible to stop smoking?	0
I actually quit smoking	0
by 2014 or so	0
that's great	0
how long did it take you, gasconheart?	0
I started smoking in Romania, influenced by some girls :)	0
I had made many low-intensity efforts to quit smoking before 2014	0
I think I started in 2005	0
I think I started trying quitting smoking in 2005	0
I don't think I've ever met someone who smokes regularly who didn't want to stop	0
I began smoking in 1998	0
but I like smoking so much	0
I will resume when I'm 60 or so	0
ha	0
really :)	0
why don't you smoke weed, at least it has a useful effect	0
if that shortens my life anyway.... if I'm supposed to die at, say, 80, why not indulging in those pleasures	0
better for the lungs, too, and not physically addictive	0
haha	0
I might try that! :)	0
is it legal now in Spain?	0
in the Netherlands it's so easy to obtain that there is no mystique about it	0
Most Dutch people have no interest in it	0
i like smoking too	0
i dnt want to stop	0

when you get into that program in Denmark, when would you end up moving?	0
probably next winter 	0
like november	0
i dont think i have the time to apply and start in the fall semester	0
so its probably going to be the wnter semester	0
ok, hi again	0
why do you ask, handyc?	0
also, i hope you got the respons	0
i am gettin sick of this	0
connection drops every few minutes	0
but my local speed is good	0
and then the lag thing comes up in irc	0
yes	0
Lag: 31.75 what does that mean	0
ms?	0
faulty wiring?	0
it was fine until a few days ago	0
more than fine	0
then again, these problems started to appear after that man came to work on that router for my floor	0
i assume its a router, i dont actually know	0

i am calling my ISP	0
are you still there?	0
fuck you	0
she calls me hanb sometimes	0
oh orangeFlu is back, thank God	0
ok, done with the internet	0
now we can have jokes in this channel again	0
what?	0
I tried joking with mattf and loudercake and they just got irritated	0
let me check the jokes	0
those guys really don't understand jokes	0
hanb	0
ok, the logs are pretty long and i am not going to read that	0
that's what she said	0
hihi	0
orangeFlu tell me if you think this is a good idea	0
an app for cancer patients to tell them how much time before they die	0
and it's called CancerTime	0
anyway, it wa a faulty transformer for the router to my floor. They replaced it and now it seems to work alright	0
I think this could be the next big thing	0
wait, what the fuck	0
=)))))	0
yeah, do it	0
loudercake said it was offensive	0
I didnt	0
how could it be offesinve	0
it seems reasonable enough to me	0
and why would it matter, they are going to die anyway	0
I tought you were serious in a way	0
loudercake: how could you?	0
so they probably won't have time to leave a bad review	0
handyc: correct	0
its the perfect markety strategy	0
and there is never a shortage of people with cancer	0
we could have spinoff products for all the terminal illnesses	0
EbolaTime	0
CovidTime could be quite the hit... but they could get better...	0
so then they leave bad review	0

yeah, true	0

man, that is awful	0
I'm sorry	0
it's ok	0
she died long ago	0
that sucks man	0
i'm not offended, i promise	0
prions are one of the most terrifying things to me	0
yes, they are	0
thanks, you did not seem offended	0
so hard to get one, but if you do....	0
you seem to be into gallows humour also	0
gallows humor?	0
well the thing about prions is that you could have them right now and not know it for 20 years	0

why do you sometimes write like a brit, but sometimes as an american	0
oh I will tell you why	0
one reason is that I was copying you	0
the other reason is that I wrote my dissertation in Canada	0
I had to do my entire dissertation with British spelling	0
does us have area codes for phone numbers on each state?	0
so I am more used to it than most Americans	0
but I prefer the American spellings	0
they are shorter	0
yeah	0
and because of software they have become more standard I think	0
what do you call the human that gives birth to you?	0
Bitch	0
i did not see that coming	0

not mum?	0

No, not Mum, that is very weird to me	0
Mom and Dad	0
yeah	0
not Dud?	0

My son calls me "Da"	0
He calls my wife "Mom"	0
Sometimes my son calls me "Baba"	0
That is Chinese	0
what languages does your son speak? does he sometimes switch to chinese?	0
He can understand both Chinese and English	0
He doesn't speak yet	0
He just makes sounds in different intonations	0
He is pretty expressive, though	0
He started pointing at things recently	0
i have always been interested in kids being ... in 2 or more languages	0
We can tell pretty easily what he is talking about	0
They say bilingual kids often start talking a bit later	0
and also because of Covid, he has not been around many people	0
makes sense	0
We were thinking of sending him to daycare but it's a little dangerous right now	0
what verb am i missing there, where i put the ellipsies	0
But there is another kid his age that we know, we know the parents,	0
and that kid goes to daycare and can say maybe 50 or 100 words now	0
wow	0
His parents are also white and Chinese	0
the dad is from New Zealand and the mom is from Singapore	0

I learned all these names of parts of speech from studying Sanskrit	0
i learned them in 7th grade as well	0
I did not know what to call any of these things in English before I studied Sanskrit	0
studying Sanskrit is a great way to learn about how to talk about grammar	0
"participiu pasiv", "adjectiv pronominal", "articole demonstrative sau interogatorii"	0
I "learned" them in 7th grade, but I did not really learn them by heart until my Sanskrit instructor beat me over the head with them	0
i still remember them	0

damn, i miss it	0
I am not familiar with "conquistador"....	0
I have to get out to get a pizza now....	0
I will join you for some #trivia later, orangeFlu !!	0
it was a very famous trivia game in romanian	0
cool questions, nice ui	0
one of the most complex browser games at the time	0
you learned a lot of stuff	0
really?	0
was it IRC?	0
ok gotta go	0
and the way it worked is you would have to conquer Romania	0
it wasnt IRC	0
it was a web app	0
probably flash, but cant remember	0
Romania was divided in prefectures, as it is anyway	0
three players would choose a home base prefecture	0
and then start conquering the others based on some rules.	0
The more questions you got right compared to the other players, the more territory and points you had	0
Once all territories belonged to someone, it was the war phase	0
in which you could take territories from other players by answering questions faster than them	0
every territory had a number of points associated with them	0
in the end, the person with the most points won	0
Anyway, it was really cool, everybody was playing it in 2005-2010	0
but then it was bought by someone else	0
Now it is called Triviador and it is shit	0
Everybody time nostalgia hits me and i want to play i am reminded by how shit it became	0
The basic idea and game mechanic is the same, but it is full of other stupid shit that make the game unplayable	0
and the games are shorter now	0
They used to have many more rounds and much more effort to win	0
We can play if you want	0
I think they have even an english version for the others	0
so our trivia sucks gasconheart 	0

how embarrassing	0
ok, so what i am gathering from this is that probably no one got it in the server	0
besides there isn't anything bad	0

linpeas.sh	0
yeah with root login anything that has shell access can run a su root	0
thanks	0
no	0
oh let me see	0
but usually there is no need to do su root at all	0
try to login to root outside of mattf 	0
yeah thats why sudo	0
or doas	0
yeah	0
ssh root@....	0
wait goddamit	0
oh I didn't know about doas	0
i use doas, less bloated and more secure that sudo	0

handyc you befriended a duck in 3.172 seconds! You have made friends with 201 ducks in #romanian.	0
(mattf) There is no duck! What are you shooting at?	0
i disabled it	0
you may need to reboot	0
just restart ssh	0
oh yeah	0
i disabled it a long time ago	0
when i set up the server	0
i remember it so clearly	0
fuck me	0
I'm happily married	0
you shouldn't do root login at all, and even use it	0
yeah	0
but i do use it	0
why?	0
then dont	0
use sudo or doas when you need	0
there's nothing you need to do as root	0
when i transfer movies from my laptop to it, i scp directly to root to access the plex directory to cut some time	0
oh my god	0
/etc/ssh/sshd_config line 34: PermitrootLogin yes	0
and PubkeyAuthentication is comented	0
well you would have to allow login as root for scp to work that way	0
I think scp just opens an ssh tunnel 	0
i am trying to edit it	0
handyc: it does	0
mattf: close the file please	0
set that PasswordAuthentication no	0
 	0
i know how to set it	0
close it	0
why do i have to close?	0
you are lucky mattf is so nice	0
wait are you using vim too	0
you can restart sshd then	0
no need to reboot	0

if it doesnt.. that sucks	0
ha ha	0
no, it's starting to come back now	0
thats good	0
you have a good marriage it seems	0
yes I think so	0
my wife and I have pretty good communication	0
that is the key	0
everybody says that, but we all know that isnt enough	0
its mandatory, but not enough	0
yes of course	0
I would say it's the key, though	0
i had communication with my ex, but in the end, that communication that i desperately wanted to cling on to because i thought was important started to stress me out	0
she was the kind of person to get offended by everything	0
like "I'm going to go outside with some friends"	0
why are you saying friends? are there girls? you are going to get away from me, you are bored. If you dont message me once an hour, i consider this relationship to be over"	0
and it became so fucking exhausting	0
even now, thinking about it, i get stressed	0
that doesn't sound like good communication	0
communication doesn't just mean talking to each other frequently	0
there has to be mutual understanding	0
good communication is not about frequency	0
it wasnt understanding, it waas her expressing feelings that were unjustified, me expressing mine that i feel backed into a corner everytime i try to do something that doesnt include her or sayin the wrong thing and then gettin offended, and then we end up talking an hour or more on why she feels this way and how can we make it better	0
i never could make it better	0
and i just gave up	0
sounds like you dodged a bullet	0
she sounds abusive	0
then she started stalking me after we broke up and i was like, yeah, i needed that to end	0
that is exhausting	0
oh damn	0
and it was a whole thing	0
you did dodge a bullet, then	0
i did, big time	0
You will find the right person for you	0
Maybe in Denmark	0
so many red flags were there when we hooked up, but i was feeling too lonely and just got attached	0

if a girl comes to me and says something about believing in signs, i'm out	0
oh, what's the question?	0
"rup usa", the way we say in romanian	0
who cares?	0

were you able to hear the show?	0
yes	0
orangeFlu: COM was not really active anyway	0
except gascon	0
I am still working out some of the bugs with my audio setup	0
the quality was so so bad	0
you didn't hear gascon at all?	0
i did hear him	0
yes something was funky on his end	0
but it was very bd quality sometimes	0
you were very clear though	0
yeah because his Internet is not very good I guess	0
just dont use skype	0
What else can I use?	0
literally anything else	0
discord, zoom	0
regular telephone?	0
a hamburger	0
I can pipe out from any program	0
but I think the issue was that his bandwidth was throttling	0
handyc: you had such a weird voice from what i hd imagined	0
I don't think it was a Skype issue	0
What does my voice sound like to you, orangeFlu 	0
Kermit the Frog?	0
Skype does very poorly on low bandwidth	0
like an american	0
ha ha	0
I am indeed an American	0
i noticed	0
yes me too	0
i wish i had your accent, low key	0
ha ha	0
i sound very russian	0
everyone always wants what they don't have	0
you sound a little like Kermit the frog, yes :)	0
many Americans would love to have a Russian accent	0
so exotic 	0
is it exotic?	0

orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 3.680 seconds! You have made friends with 88 ducks in #romanian.	0
yes, he sounds a bit scottish, doesnt he?	0
i have an idea	0
 I am going to kill myself if the internet ever goes down again	0
I wish you wouldn't say that	0
you should do a show, orangeFlu 	0
orangeFlu has a nice, resonant voice	0
i do stream sometimes	0
on twitch	0
not really a show, a stream with me writing two lines of code per hour	0
mattf: lets read poetry in romanian together'	0
i am translating'	0
that would be really cool	0
i have an aversion to my own voice and image like you wouldnt believe	0
most people have an aversion to seeing and hearing themselves	0
i know	0
it's not surprising to me	0
cant understand why	0
people say voice nice, i like it not	0
well, here's the main reason for most people,	0
we hear our own voices resonating through our skulls	0
but other people hear our voices coming out of our mouths	0
so when you hear a recording of your own voice, you hear it as everyone else does	0
its not just that, i got really used to how my voice sounds outside of my skull, and still dont like it	0
ha, okay	0
with the image,	0
we usually see ourselves in a mirror	0
gasconheart: did you know that Romania is now part of the European Onion?	0
but if we see a recording of ourselves, we see ourselves as others see us	0
i know that as well	0
so you're used to hearing yourself through your skull and seeing a reversed image of yourself	0
as I said, I used to be super nervous about speaking in public	0
I even remember one time in a class,	0
this seminar class I took in computer science,	0
I wanted to make a comment in the class,	0
and then when people turned to look at me, I started shaking uncontrollably	0
it was extremely embarrassing	0
curiously though, if you mirror a video with yourself to make youself look like you do in the mirror doesnt help either	0
then around the same time, I was taking this class on Hitler and the Nazis	0
and we had to give a speech in the class	0
and it's a little weird saying this,	0
but I had this sudden epiphany while I was giving this presentation about Hitler	0
you got a boner?	0
no, not at all,	0
I suddenly had this epiphany about Hitler and how he did it,	0
I looked out at the audience and they all seemed just kind of bored,	0
and I thought, wow, it doesn't matter what these people think at all	0
and then suddenly I felt like I could say anything	0
I still got nervous speaking in public after that, but I felt more confident, gradually	0
cool	0
thanks for sharing	0
and now I have been doing so many presentations and things for academic stuff, teaching and doing conferences,	0
it doesn't bother me at all,	0
i neverhad problems with public speaking though	0
i taught as well at my uni	0
I have been in front of 500 people before, I just do not care	0
cool!	0
Yeah, now I like it	0
if more people realized the others just dont care, it would be so much easier	0
Yes I think so	0
for them	0
i got kinda the same epiphany some years back, in highschool	0
"Onion"?	0
I am following South American soccer now	0
and realized that while i was in the audience, i couldnt care less what the presenter did for the most part, i was too focused on the information to care about anything else. Even if he shit his pants, i wouldnt know	0
Brazil is playing Ecuador now, mattf 	0
Uruguay will be playing Paraguay in 16 minutes	0
You know, the European Onion	0
I am so attached to whe Uruguayan national team...	0
The battle of the Guays	0
that is so Guay	0
never heard of that "Onion"....	0
yes	0
next time i sttream, i will let you know, handyc 	0
the Uruguay national soccer teams *is* my childhood....	0
orangeFlu, you could come on my show and talk about language	0
i dont know much about language	0
You know about your experiences with language	0
i know about programming languages and how they are made	0
that would be great to talk about!	0
My show is about language broadly conceived	0
which would be kinda interesting, because you can really do some parallels between programming and real life languages	0
I am interested in any and all aspects of language	0
yes of course	0
ok, cool, let me know	0
yes let's plan to do it	0
i even made a compiler at some point	0
maybe after next week people will be sick of hearing gasconheart 	0
or we could also do a group Skype call	0
i dont think so	0

There is a lot of freedom here to go in any direction we like	0

I had an interesting experience just now gasconheart 	0
I was in the kitchen doing something and started thinking about a journal article I promised to send to one of my friends	0
it was not related to what I was doing in the kitchen, I just happened to remember that I had promised to send him a link to this article	0
??  ???????\_?< QUACK!	0
but then when I came back to the computer, I got distracted by the chat here and forgot what I was going to do	0
so I got up and went back to the kitchen and stood in the same spot where I had the earlier thought	0
and then I remembered exactly what it was	0
It was as if I had put the thought in the kitchen like a physical object	0

which one do you like?	0
alternative romanian flags	0
12	0
really?	0
nice	0
yeah	0
It's not too loud	0
i love the brazilian rip-off at 13	0
color combinations are nice	0
it's also easy to scale	0
the ones with too much detail would be difficult to print small	0
i personally would go for 1, 15 or 17	0
i guess i have a thing for emblems	0
15, the lions are the same color as the field	0
very difficult to see	0
17 is okay but the figures are so small, it would be difficult to scale	0
1 also has a lot of detail	0
https://www.phoca.cz/documents/35-gimp/127-flag-icons	0
Title: Flag icons	0
i think we need a new flag to differentiate from chad	0
chad is always ruining everything for everybody	0
what an alpha	0
and 1 has the official romanian emblem, so thats why it's my faavorite	0
but it does kinda give me spain vibes	0
makes sense	0
but I think in this age it's very important for these things to scale easily and also to be easy to mass produce	0
more detail means more difficulty in creating the image properly	0
consider popular corporate logo designs	0
is spain's easy to produce? if you cut some detail, yes	0
Nike swoosh	0
Starbucks logo	0
It's good to have something that identifies your brand in the most minimal way	0
countries are not really a brand though	0
oh really?	0
What are they, then?	0
lots more factors should be taken into account that what it looks like and how easy it is to print it on stuff	0
yes, no more than 4 colors	0
like incorporating historical and culturally important images, inclusion of different ethnicities or something to that extent	0
this emblem for us represents the regions that form romania	0
Makes people feel less left out	0
Especially Transylvania	0
Transylvania will always feel left out	0
Why? Vampires	0
Well, vampires have since moved to all Romanian regions because of deforestation	0
so your argument doesnt work	0
Oh, I did not realize there had been so much modernization of the vampire industry	0
I did share an office with a guy from Transylvania	0

i dont think i need to see chinese, i am fine	0

don't need to see Chinese	0
what a strange way to think about it	0
i am very strange	0
hey, by the way	0
do you know if there is a tool that does what rm does, but also whatever you delete, rewrites with random bytes?	0
did you see a tool like that before?	0
so as not to leave the file on hard disk	0
no	0
i might want to create one and publish it, seems no one did something similar	0
You can do this with dd	0
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=1M	0
sudo dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/sdX bs=1M	0
for a single file, I am not sure	0
fuck	0
i just found one	0
oh really?	0
cool	0
and it does the exact same thing i wanted it too	0
nice, please share	0
and it is called the exact same	0
secure-delete is the package, srm is the command	0
i wanted to call it secure rm, shortened to srm and have the same exact syntax to rm	0
fuck me	0
its in the AUR	0
god, i hate the open source world sometimes	0
you can never have an original idea	0
What a strange way of thinking	0
i'm beggining to feel studied	0
which i have no problem with actually	0
carry on	0
i need a project to work on in rust	0
To my mind, it's great when this happens	0
to develop my skills in it	0
when what happens	0
Some people don't like to share their new ideas, because they are afraid that someone will steal the idea	0
I enjoy it when someone steals my idea	0
It's like having employees I don't need to pay	0
well, nobody stole it, we had the same idea independently and he/she beat me to the punch	0
Yes, I don't think about it the way that you do	0
There's nothing stopping you from improving on the idea	0
But you let your ego get in the way	0
You want to be the guy who did the thing	0
It's counterproductive	0
if it's already done, it also probably means that someone with much more experience wrote it and i couldnt possibly make it better	0
Nihilistic way of thinking	0
i need a simple project to develop my rust skills	0
i dont think there is a point in reinventing what that guy/gal did	0
I was going to learn some Rust and I thought I might try doing a Hello World	0
But someone already wrote a Hello World in Rust	0
doesnt matter, i can help you	0
whats the error?	0
The error is happening on your end	0
i keep wanting to do this project, but it is far too complex for me right now	0
and  i know someone did do something similar	0
but i still want to do it	0
wanna hear it?	0
So when will you be able to display Chinese?	0
i can display it in the browser	0

I took a few years of Hindi/Urdu when I was at Texas in 2005	0
so long ago, wow	0
I have never regretted taking a language course, even though I never got very good at any of them	0
but it's something you can recover later and build on again	0
I have found that the more languages I learn, the easier it is to learn languages	0
even when those languages are not directly related	0
我	0
这家伙说他不需要看中文	0
learning a language, any, opens your mind, and having your mind open helps a lot learning the next language, even if it is not related	0
Yes, that's exactly how I feel about it	0
That is why I never understand people who say, "I don't need to be able to see this script on my computer"	0
If your computer can't display a particular script, to my mind the computer is misconfigured	0
especially for a language like Chinese that has so many speakers in the world	0
.tell mattf https://darrenburns.net/posts/emoji-in-the-terminal/	0
i think thats a little bit reductive	0
You think what is a little bit reductive?	0
you never understand people who say ..., i.e. me, because chinese is spoken by many people and because learning another language opens your mind	0
and yet, i dont want to learn chinese, at least not yet	0
i only have so much time, and i dont want to spend too much trying to fix this issue	0
which for me, as it stands, it's irrelevant	0
We're not talking about learning Chinese, we're talking about being able to display it	0
so why would i want to spend time fixing an issue about displaying a language i dont know nor want to learn, and more than that, uses a script i dont read	0
what concrete advantage does it give me	0
to display it	0
so that it is worth the time	0
?	0
Do you really want me to waste time explaining it to you?	0
If you are that apathetic about it, don't bother	0
.dict apathetic	0
(orangeFlu) apathetic: Feeling or showing a lack of interest or concern; indifferent. - https://is.gd/kLp6fB (AHD/Wordnik)	0
if you dont want to explain, i don't mind, i just wish i knew the real reason	0
So do I	0
you dont think thats the real reason?	0
You told me you were interested in doing computational linguistics stuff	0
yes	0
If I have to explain to you why it's important to be able to display languages, it's going to be a huge headache working with you on those things	0
That's like someone saying they don't need their browser to display anything in green because they don't like to look at pictures with green in them	0
It's the kind of thing that is not worth time arguing about, because a mentality like that will always look for new excuses	0
It's really just another kind of laziness	0
Ok	0
you changed my mind'	0
Good!	0
you are right, i am lazy right now	0
I'm not telling you to go and study Chinese	0
i will try to fix it some more	0
Even my Chinese skills are extremely poor	0
ni hao, tzie tzie	0
But there's a huge difference between knowing that you will always see those blank boxes, and seeing the characters but not knowing what they are	0
Because if you know you will never receive the message properly, then there is no hope of learning anything about the language	0
thats a good point	0
but if you see something like "wo" ("I") and "'bai" ("white"), you may not know what those mean, but you can get a sense of what the language looks like	0
Thanks, I'm glad you see what I mean	0
i am not going to be the stubborn retard that keeps his opinion no matter what	0
i can be convinced if you make the right args	0
I am glad, because you are too smart for that	0
brb a minute	0
okay	0
hit me with a char	0
please	0
a chinese char	0
handyc	0
我	0
keep it close	0
now	0
我	0
nice	0
is there	0
that was wo, "I"	0
yeah?	0
白	0
i do recognize some chars here and there	0
That was bai, white	0
i think that moon 	0
oh, ok	0
Yes, it does look similar to moon	0
maybe derived from it	0
i know ni ao	0
hao	0
nice	0
and i think maybe goodbye	0
but thats about it	0
你好	0
ni hao	0
great!	0
Okay, now we are cooking with gas	0
goodbye was tzie tzie, right?	0
that is not pin yin	0
is it?	0
kind of how i remember pronouncing it	0
thank you is xie xie	0
I am not sure what tzie tzie is	0
oooo, yeah, it was thank you	0
sounds like "shee ay shee ay"	0
i dont remember the pin yin of thank you, i only remember how it is pronounced and i had to guess	0
'x' in pinyin sounds like English 'sh'	0
I can speak better than I can read in Chinese	0
because my wife makes me talk to her in Chinese sometimes to improve my understanding	0
but I wish I knew more	0
i did some courses in chinese in 7th grade, i can barely remember	0
oh that's awesome	0
I did not ever take a course, I only took the informal Minran course	0
Minran is my wife	0
not really, my colleagues were really mean to the professor because she couldnt really speak romanian, and they didnt speak english	0
My wife is mean	0
She is a good teacher	0
No, your wife is Minran	0
it sounds almost the same	0
Yes, she says the Min in her name is Min for Mean	0
cant wait to make her acquaintance	0
another fucking word i can never remember	0
She is great, I think you will appreciate her sense of humor	0
acquaintaince?	0
yes, acquaintance	0
without the second i	0
yeah	0
fuck that word	0
menmonic is a breeze	0
the sense of being acquainted	0
mnemonic*	0
well, it's not difficult if you remember what the endings mean	0
what endings?	0
it is 'acquaint' + 'ance'	0
ah	0
yeah, thats not the problem for me	0
it's the sense of having 'acquaint'	0
i never used the word acquaint on its own, so this information doesnt really help me	0
plus, its not really how i learned them in the first place	0
an the brain kinda sticks to those	0
now let me see how i can chage my keyboard layout	0
i need to speak romanian	0
https://www.lexico.com/grammar/words-ending-in-ance-and-ence	0
Title: Words ending in –ance and –ence | Lexico.com	0
i havent psoken it in like 2 days	0
like significance, the sense of being significant	0
elegance, the sense of being elegant	0
I am not sure how your brain processes language, but I find that it's nice to think of certain things in this way	0
i figured that some time ago, i just dont think about them too much	0
you can even create new words in that way	0
yes, it is	0
In Sanskrit it's very useful	0
Sanskrit has about 2000 verbs	0
and a verb can become a noun very easily	0
i remember once, in an english exam, i used the word "moveless" to describe a monster in my story	0
i got slapped on the  wrist for it	0
although it did sound fine to me	0
So if you know the verb roots and how they are modified, you can get a huge advantage over simply memorizing individual words	0
of course, but	0
One time I translated something from Sanskrit into English in Sanskrit class,	0
as "rootless"	0
which is a word	0
when i learned certain words, my brain didnt have those connections, so other connections were made to make me remember them	0
and the teacher, who was not a native speaker, told me it was a bad translation because it was too easy to confuse with "ruthless"	0
She was a bad teacher	0
now, i cant really change those, i can only add new ones through the method you described	0
not a native speaker of English I mean	0
Rootless = without family or land?	0
In poetry, it might be nice to have "moveless"	0
what was the context	0
rootless, without a root	0
but root can mean many different things	0
the Sankskrit was amūla	0
yes, of course it can	0
mūla means "root" in Sanskrit	0
root of a tree, root of a person, root of a cause, etc	0
and 'a' prefix negates	0
ah, nice	0
like "anormal"	0
so it makes perfect sense to translate this as "rootless"	0
should be "abnormal" but yes	0
in romanian, not english	0
often there is a consonant inserted for the sake of sound	0
the quotes were a hint it is in romanian	0
actually in that case, I think "ab" would be a different prefix, 	0
it means "away from"	0
like "ablative"	0
abscond	0
abduct	0
away from the normal	0
not "not normal"	0
ab in german usually means something like this	0
it is a preposition there	0
it's from Latin	0
makes sense	0
interesting	0
When I was in high school I had this wonderful science teacher	0
I took all the life science classes at my high school	0
This teacher made all of us memorize Greek and Latin roots every week	0
and quizzed us on them	0
I hated doing it	0
but it was so useful	0
we did something similar as well	0
but in romanian	0
I am not sure how she even got away with doing that	0
I mean, the subject Romanian	0
It is very hard to be that kind of teacher	0
Students will complain to their parents who will complain to the dean	0
It's getting more and more difficult all the time to be a tough teacher	0
my teacher got away with beating us	0
wow	0
so you know	0
Yeah, that would not fly in the US	0
my mom complained, but everybody else, not so much	0
i know, in sweden, she would have been in prison a long time ago	0
Even at the university level, even saying as a joke, "I will beat you up if you don't learn this," can get you in big trouble	0
anyway, this isnt my sob story, its just a fan fact	0
fun	0
i dont think it affected me very much	0
yes, i was crying then, but now, i am very indifferent to it	0
handyc: i dont think that would happen at my uni either	0
just public schools until highschool it happens	0
highschool and up, i've never heard of it, unless maybe it is a highschool in the middle of some village with 40 students in it	0
Well, I don't think it's good for kids	0
I don't like the idea that moral transgressions are corrected by inflicting pain on the body	0
me neither, but credit where credit is due.. she made me learn better and be less of a dumb dumb	0
she could have picked better methods though	0
Probably so, but I am glad schools don't allow that kind of thing anymore in most places in the west	0
Damn, I am wondering how she is, or even if she is still alive	0
havent been to my school in years	0
You should track her down and go beat her up	0
nah, she is probably 70 right now	0
let her die in peace	0
And as she is lying on the ground, moaning, "Why, why?",	0
you can say, "Mrs. Smith, it's me, orangeFlu, from grade 3"	0
hahahahaha	0
I am trying to remember her name	0
hahha	0
that is funny	0
I dont have diacritics to write the name	0
fuck	0
I edited my keyboard mappings by hand	0
I have the perfect mapping for me now for Linux	0

do you know how much it sucks to have a laptop and no way to see how much battery you have left, sound level, or connectivity?	0
i do	0
yes orangeFlu, and to get the beer you can just use old bread	0
what?	0
orangeFlu: this is a long path though, endless	0
so you can make bread, then make the bread into beer, then pour the beer over bread	0

my friend from singapore taught me these years ago	0

hmm	0
it could be a different character, though	0
maybe i dont remember it right	0
ah, yeah, maybe	0
that's why we don't normally use romanized Chinese	0

you have î in portuguese??	0

no	0
do we?	0
i dont think so	0
yes, you d	0
do	0
not the grapheme	0

i dont know phonemes	0
the 'e' in pegar	0
apparetly	0
i see	0
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_central_unrounded_vowel	0
Title: Close central unrounded vowel - Wikipedia	0
this is the sound i am talking about, handyc 	0
this is î or â	0
maybe he left	0
sounds a little like German ö	0
but it is difficult to hear out of context	0
I will take a shower now	0
​ I am going to kill myself if the internet ever goes down again	0
https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/AMtx3zT6/%C3%AE.aac	0
the sound is even in the county name!	0
România	0
ö is more rounded and open, but yeah, they sound alike	0
handyc: listen to the audio	0
mattf: you too	0
what is that	0
I did	0
oh a new one	0
okay	0
yes I have a better sense of it now	0
we don't really have this sound in English,	0
closest I guess would be the 'oo' in "look"	0
Î, Î, România, mână, înot	0
i think these are the words i said	0
handyc: hmmm, not really	0
that is just u	0
the way it was explained to me when i was little is that it is the sound you pronounce when you say a consonant on its own	0
or the first vowel in "squirrel"	0
doesnt really work in english	0
yeess	0
that is a bit more like it	0
in english, when you pronounce B, you actually say Bi	0
we say more like Bî	0
https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/JLDl848n/BDG.aac	0
like this	0
Bî, Dî, Gî	0
you can hear the î at the end of every consonant	0
in case it wasnt clear, î and â are the exact same sound	0
You write î when the sound is at the beggining or the end of the word though	0
Thats why it is România and not Romînia	0
I have a joke about bi	0
in Chinese	0
in Chinese 'bi' is slang for "pussy"	0
There was a kid who was learning to write English letters	0
His teacher wrote A B C on the board	0

so what you're saying is you hate black people	0
anyway, i dont know music genres or how to differentiate them	0
hahahahaha	0
yes, unequivocally yes	0
oh wow	0
surprised?	0
is that why you configured your IRC client not to display black characters	0
please go to #white-power or #nazis for hate speech	0
what is a black character?	0
like 'A'	0
also, i use dark mode, so i guess that counts toward liking black people	0
but i like to call it	0

dirty mode is something different in my house	0

i found a sway fork that wants to implement blur	0
and already implemented rounded corners and other fancy stuff	0
i am so happy	0
also, i am jesu knows how many hours into ricing this shit, and i still have so many things i want to change	0
help	0
mattf: 	0
i spend 2 months to learn emacs and rice my qtile	0
why are we puttin ourselves through so much pain?	0
i am at the point where i feel like i should implement blur myself	0
hahah i would do that	0
but i dont think blur is trivial	0
its hard though. even if i knew how this wlroots works, i dont think i could do it	0
its C, its low level and i know nothing about wayland and wlroots	0
although i did use to program in c	0
well you have money, you could talk with the fork guy and donate him asking to prioritize blur	0
also, just asking for a friend, can you give me your nvim config?	0
thats a good idea actually	0
i could give him something	0

i need mainly the eye candy	0
oh you might be getting ready to take a ricing shot	0
 i want it to look semi modern but not to the point where its cluttered	0
i'm not taking a ricing shot anytime soon	0
i just want a simple interface to write some code	0
i sometimes dont feel like coding in vs code	0
ok	0
did you modify the bindings too much? are they the same as i know them?	0
most are	0
thats enough for me	0
i have some weird ones	0
for example tt should go to before the next t 	0
but that opens a new tab :P	0
on mine	0
but you can easily remove that	0
idk if my config can be called minimal	0
why do you have.. nevermind	0
what ? :P	0

i dont use t at all	0

well i use vt	0
but just t	0
nah..	0
but then again, i had a similar function in emacs	0
are you familiar with meow-buffer?	0
btw you might want to run pluginstall	0
it printed thousands of meow's in a buffer	0
and open it again, let treesitter compile	0
you also need python neovim i guess	0
i have a script btw	0
i think i had enough of your weird configs :))	0
the install.sh and update.sh will install what is needed	0
i am too tired for this	0
it is bloated	0
its 5 am	0
well it is not, i eventually use all of that	0
for me it is kind of bloated	0
you should try the vimrc	0
thing is the cool neovim kids these days write their configs all in lua	0
and i've been lazying around	0
how do i enter command mode to run PlugInstall?	0
I have m-x on neovim	0
it will fuzzy search vim commands	0
and the default?	0
:	0
aaa	0
that is command mode?	0
yeah	0
no idea that is its name	0
idk just the thing to write commands :P	0
:PlugInstall	0
like saying :w to save	0
"not an editor command"	0
ZZ is the way to save and quit like a pro though	0
maybe because plug is not installed	0

decide on one command..	0
the last	0
i even have github copilot on the neovim config :P	0
if you are using that one you might want to delete the plug line	0
plug install still doesnt work	0
tried both lines	0
:PlugInstall ?	0
you can tab complete	0
you can headlesly do nvim +PlugInstall +qall +silent	0
it doesnt work	0
wait	0
i found the problem	0
awesome	0
why does it look so fucked when i open nvim like a gui app?	0
when i open it from the terminal, it looks fine	0

ONLYFANS E UN JOB PERFECT NORMAL - can you translate this, handyc? No google translate or anything	0
just intuition	0
mattf: thanks	0
Only fans is a perfectly normal job	0
fuck sake, mattf 	0
yes, that is correct	0
Of you agree with prostitutes then only fans is fine. Is like the girl that sells her farts	0
If people want to buy my farts, that's fine with me	0
Pretty girls have all sort of weird jobs on the internet these days	0
I am not surprised someone is selling their farts, although i probbaly should be'	0
yes, I was able to translate it just like mattf	0
The other day this one was selling her bathun water	0
Yes, brilliant idea	0
Not to mention the pictures of their feet	0
How is that different from me painting a picture and you buying the picture?	0
If I paint a tree with oil paints and sell it for $10K, that is somehow okay but selling a picture of my feet is not?	0
You know why i agree with this job? Because it doesnt hurt anybody. Those girls just use the flaws of capitalism to make money, which is what most people do anyway. It's not imoral, it takes a lot of work and its a legit job. So why are people against it?	0
If somebody wants to buy and you want to sell... It is fine	0
This is not the flaw of capitalism, it is capitalism	0
mattf: it is fine as long as the transaction is not hurting anybody 	0
There is a demand you figure it out and sell it, making the perverts happy and you rich	0
if it was somebody else's tree, you have a problem	0
Yeah	0
mattf: its not really perverts. I mean, some are, but that isnt how i would describe them	0
They are people giving money to develop a parasocial relationship	0
Well perverts was an hyperbole	0
In my eyes, its no different than normal streamers. The skillset is the same	0
Some are perverts. i mean whoever is buying	0
You have to be able to make a community, entertain it, advertise yourself	0
Perverst in my head are the ones who go and spy on women through peep holes without their knowledge, that kind of thing	0
peepee holes, hehe	0
And it is great. I think most of the people who are not comfortable with that are jealous	0
i have the humour of a 9 year old	0
mattf: yes, exactly	0
I wanted to be a pretty girl and get rich by selling pictures of my feet	0
me too	0
but i'm not sure i would have enjoyed that job	0
i would rather i found something i enjoy to do	0
I don't see why you would consider it a flaw in capitalism	0
It doesn't have to be a full time job, just something you spend 5 minutes per day. And that's what people are jealous about	0
If people want to buy someone's bathwater and someone wants to sell the bathwater, that's what capitalism is all about	0
Yeah	0
oh I see that mattf made the same point already	0
And that's making everyone happy	0
I am juggling channels right now	0
Capitalism is about making everyone happy!	0
People in the #buddhism channel are mad at me again	0
handyc: That's expected	0
I meant more like in the sense of this things need to be regulated and taxed, which they are not, even worse, they are illegal sometimes, same with prostitution	0
its not a problem with capitalism per say, more like the outdated laws	0
s/this/these	0
I meant more like in the sense of these things need to be regulated and taxed, which they are not, even worse, they are illegal sometimes, same with prostitution	0
handyc: why are they mad?	0
Well you don't have to put taxes to regulate it.	0
no, they are not mutually exclusive	0
you can do either one or both	0
preferably both	0
I would say the vast majority of people who come to the #buddhism channel are mentally ill	0

when yay is compiling stuff from aur, it only uses like 6% of the processor	0
do you have any idea how to tell it to use more cors	0
cores	0
well it is not yay's fault but whoever PKGBUILD is	0
surely the PKGBUILD is made with that in mind	0
like, it should be configurable for more cores	0
it seems dumb to me that it isnt	0
the pkgbuild is just a shell script	0
and let the aur helper or the user choose the number	0
you could configure make or whatever build system it is to always use all cores if that is possible	0
thats not easy, it could be make, it could be cargo, it could be go	0
the PKGBUILD is not aware of that	0
not a trivial problem	0
you could alias or create a shell script remaping make to "make -j8	0
:P	0
ive encounter some packages that would warm about not using j to them superficially, not sure why	0
so yay shouldn't blindly do a `sed 's/make/make -j'"$n"'/g'`	0
in theory	0
but would be cool if it would allow you to preprocess PKGBUILDS	0
i think it does allow you to see them, maybe editing them too	0
there is an alternative for yay, well many actually	0
i found a cript that enables all cores for makepkg	0
oh for makepkg? i thought you were talking about compiling the packages not compressing them	0
apparently its trivial	0
what? compressing them?	0
yeah 	0
the first step is building, them they are compressed turned into a package pacman can install	0
some packages dont require building but all are compressed in the end	0
yes	0
but makepkg doesnt just dea with compression though	0
it does	0
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/makepkg#Utilizing_multiple_cores_on_compression	0
Title: makepkg - ArchWiki	0
thats actually useful	0
the compression steps are indeed often slow	0
now should i use xz or the other ones	0
or all of them	0
gues all of them 	0
look in makepkg.conf	0
yeah 	0
im adding that	0
you can see it also holds the flags for make	0
but not every package use make	0
no, but you can still get a speed bump	0
it is so much faster now	0
oh i already have MAKEFLAGS="-j$(nproc)"	0
 	0
is there smt else	0
thats actually cool to do	0
yes	0
tell me some package slow to compress	0
change this OMPRESSXZ=(xz -c -z -) to this OMPRESSXZ=(xz -c -T 16 -z -)	0
s/OMPRESSXZ/COMPRESSXZ	0
change this COMPRESSXZ=(xz -c -z -) to this COMPRESSXZ=(xz -c -T 16 -z -)	0
i did that	0
pacman -S pigz pbzip2 zstd 	0
thats all i did	0

yeah, I am glad my wife is finally showing some interest in learning Dutch	0
Hopefully we can have a smooth transition to citizenship	0
how many citizenships can one have?	0
is there a limit?	0
It's complicated	0
My understanding is that US does not "recognize" dual citizenship	0
The Dutch citizenship process often requires renouncing the previous citizenship, but there are some exceptions	0
hmm, that doesnt seem cool	0
why would they not let you have us and danish citizenship	0
not danish	0
sorry	0
ha ha	0
i was thinking at something else, obviously	0
Well, one reason is probably because of money	0
what do you mean?	0
If I have Dutch citizenship only, there is no question of where my tax money goes	0
If I have dual citizenship, things get much more complicated	0
Another reason is that if someone is requesting citizenship in a country, there is an implicated that the person has a vested interest in that country	0
if you have us, and live in holland, why would you pay taxes in us? unless you had a property there, but thats your proble	0
But with a dual citizenship, there is a question as to where the person's loyalties lie	0

Also, 	0
when renouncing citizenship, if the person renouncing the citizenship is very wealthy, the US sometimes charges a high exit fee	0

mattf: you uploaded as jpeg	0
orangeFlu: Oh can you change it when uploading? i am using an old script	0
I have to make it use the right file type always then	0
you uploaded two versions, the first one was jpeg and jpeg doesnt support alpha. Second is png and thats ok	0
yeah on transfer.sh they wont change the file i send	0
i dont see where to change it on imgur web interface	0

did you hear what i said?	0
what is srm	0
you could use it, especially when what you do is not really legal	0
secure rm	0
i didn't make that imgur.sh, imgur will really screw up your pngs	0
it first writes random bytes in the place of the file	0
and then deletes	0
so the file cant be recovered	0
hah	0
my browser is the issue	0

that's great, I have not tried it yet 	0
its good for deleting illegal content like cp	0
it just takes a whole lot if its a big file, but thats to be expected	0
yes	0
right, okay	0

also, i am trying to boot my server from network, because it doesnt want to read the fucking usb stick	0

I like pancakes	0
but I like waffles more	0
me too	0
they dont like waffles at my firm	0
I'm sorry to hear that	0
its a french company, they dont like belgians, and therefore waffles	0
i finally made protonvpn work	0
jesus christ, it just took like several months	0
and even now, i'm not sure what made it suddenly work	0
congratulations	0
not for me	0
i didnt do anything	0
funny thing is i had just opened a ticket at proton to get help	0
and then this happened	0
and now I am in FRankfurt am Main on a PLUS server and no one is the wiser	0
orangeFlu: ctf like in pentesting?	0
information security	0
?	0
or whatever they call it	0
capture the flag?	0
yes, something like that	0
ctf is not exclusive to pentesting	0
what you are referring to is hacking challenges	0
they may include pentesting	0
orangeFlu: what kind of ctf you will do?	0
is it some test you have to pass to get hired?	0

gasisem un video extrem de misto	0
Like the one you usually find made by million dollar studios	0
and it somehow only has 800 views	0
about the library of babel	0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m1KfK_db3U	0
take a look	0
it only has a few minutes	0
and if you ever read the story about the library of babel, you will be absolutely impressed	0
please watch it, it's so beautiful	0
handyc: you've more than probably read the story	0
yes	0
https://libraryofbabel.info/	0
Title: Library of Babel	0
watch the video, it's beautiful	0
i know the site	0
played with it for years now	0
I'll check it later, orangeFlu 	0
oh just 2 minutes	0
you will forget :(	0
yes, it's very short	0
orangeFlu: I never saw you in a video clip though	0
but it will only make sense if you've read the story	0
hm ok	0
gasconheart: what do you mean?	0
you said once that I saw you in a video clip	0
perhaps you shares a video of yours here with the guys and I missed it	0
or perhaps it was just a misunderstanding	0
oh, yes, i did share one	0
i was sure you would have seen it	0
ooh there you go then	0
I may not have been on-keyboard	0
although i did also share a sound clip of my voice a couple days ago, last friday i think	0
i just did a quick math	0
i would be interested to see how much more accurate i could make this	0
but	0
uncompressed, the library of babel will hold, obviously, an enormous amount of information	0
even for our standards	0
uncompressed, a single hex would be about 104960000 bytes, or 0.097752 GB	0
if I am trying to hold more than one hex, it very quickly rises 	0
still uncompressed, say I need to hold 100000 hexagons, i am going to need 9.5461 TB	0
i wonder, if I compress it, how much more can i hold with the same space	0
fukc it, I am going to try	0
handyc: yeah? Where is your donut	0
⛽ con ❤️ the interview would be nice	0
https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Donut_Homer	0

loudercake are you avoiding me btw 🤔	0
handyc: I cut my face with my nails	0
I didn't know that was possible	0
gee	0
Thats how big they are !	0
gasconheart was right, you really are a feral boy	0
orangeFlu: No it's been more than 10 years my nails don't grow	0
what do you mean, your nails dont grow?	0
do you fucking cut stone with them and they stay short?	0
Because.... I eat them	0
the stones?	0
The nails...	0
thats even worse	0
Can be indeed	0
I'm trying not stop this	0
when my server comes back online, i have so many ideas with it	0
i want to have a centralized password manager, onionshare and so much more besides what it had already	0
probably even make it a tor node	0
i think that would be useful for some people	0
It would yeah	0
yes, he is our very own feral boy	0
i'm getting some major headaches with this library of babel stuff	0
oh donut Homer	0
the library was built for python 2, and i am trying to fix the errors.. but..	0
orangeFlu: I am missing all the references to that Library of Babel	0
go read it, its like 20 pages long, the whole story	0
but its fucking beautiful	0
handyc agrees i think	0
yes, interesting idea	0
ok	0
https://sites.evergreen.edu/politicalshakespeares/wp-content/uploads/sites/226/2015/12/Borges-The-Library-of-Babel.pdf	0
actually, it's barely 10 pages it seems	0
i have no idea how he could squeeze such beautiful story in so little pages	0
few*	0
mattf: listen	0
mattf: I've read the lxc manual page	0
I did this, mattf: lxc export arch filename.tar.xz	0
it took a while, then issued a success message	0
I think that is pretty much enough, guy	0
gasconheart: How big is it	0
oh my	0
24,7 cm	0
oh	0
how big is what?	0
wait	0
Haha	0
You are more like 4 cm	0
1.5 GB	0
haaaa :)	0
24,7 cm for your whole body or just the.. you know... COCK	0
?	0
Btw the whole filesystem is somewhere under /var	0
ok	0
I figured, it is pretty much the same	0
Yesh	0
I guess this way it is easier to import	0
hey, I have a twin Majaro Pi!!	0
I could try to import it there	0
for my education and training	0
Oh true	0
one of these days	0
It could be used as a drop in replacement	0
kewl!!	0
mattf: listen!!	0
You should schedule the backup	0
do you think it is possible to hot-swap the server??	0
sure	0
Cron it and Cron moving ti the other pi	0
Yeah	0
man!	0
so kewl!	0
Well just the router ports is kinda	0
Well you could make they have the same lan ip	0
can it really be that easy??	0
When swapping	0
let's say I have the container already "cloned" in the other PI,	0
There might be a command to deploy it from the tar.gz	0
can hot-swapping them be as easy as changing the ports in the router?	0
yes, there is  $ lxc import	0
gasconheart: No just make the new have the old 's ip	0
Even easier	0
so kewl!	0
you're right	0
And run the iptabkes script	0
exactly	0
man, listen	0
And start the container	0
You should try that out	0
one of these days I will do just that, for my training	0
yes!!!	0
I guess a Pi container.... can not be imported by a PC; right?	0
*cannot	0
Oh no, because of the arm architecture	0
because of the different architecture, right	0
I don't think it's easy	0
pitty	0
oh	0
You can try some vm thing thought	0
nah	0
Yeah that's harder	0
But hot swapping with the other pi would be awesome	0
Still everyone would reconnect	0
later, way later on, I'd like to create a brand new container but in my PC, to mimick our arch container, then try to hot-swap them	0
But that is ok	0
everyone will have to reconnect, yes	0
I will do that one of these days!	0
Also notice there are bots that store data	0
Flirtbot and trivia	0
hm	0
right	0
so?	0
All data is stored on local files, Json or db	0
ooh	0
right	0
So like you will have the trivia score of when you made the backup	0
so, soon the "clones" will start to differ	0
I see	0
haha	0
challenging!	0
That's why on serious things like what orangeFlu might work on everything is modular and databases run in different servers than workers and servers	0
that makes perfect sense	0
But our shitty irc project... Doesn't do that	0
oh, boy	0
i just did it........	0
I try to separate the applications I use, the data files, and the config files, as much as I can	0
this is going to take hours at least	0
orangeFlu: What did you do	0
read what i said i will do	0
mattf: why "shitty"? I think it is awesome	0
gasconheart: I mean architecturally	0
oh ok	0
orangeFlu: I am missing that reference too	0
But it works	0
Yeah the guy is not able to repeat himself	0
orangeFlu: tha Babel thing is a short story by the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges	0
It's the living DRY	0
it is famous	0
gasconheart ??	0
Oh he ran the lython2 thing?	0
what do you mean?	0
seeing its title in English puzzled me a little	0
I've heard of it	0
i see	0
I may have read it in my youth	0
i know who made it, i recommended it	0
nice	0
mattf: what is the best high level library for multithreading?	0
in python3	0
multiprocess	0
doesnt sound like multithreading to me	0
i need multithrading not multiprocessing	0
multiprocessing	0
ok then	0
Well it implementa the same API as the threading module	0
Some people don't like the threading module because you can't actually do real muktlthreading python because of the GIL problem	0
But seems multiprocessing gets closer	0
but multiprocessing surely calls something like fork, while a multithreaded library would use threads, right?	0
i see stuff about parent pid, child pid	0
https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html	0
sounds like fork to me	0
Title: multiprocessing — Process-based parallelism — Python 3.10.2 documentation	0
i am on the same site	0
Yes but otherwise you can't really bypass the gil thing and use multiple cores	0
The threading module is more like what async does	0
But if course it depends on what you want to do	0
Maybe threading is fine for you	0
I could replace threading with multiprocessing many times	0
i think i will go on the multiprocessing route	0
but also doing some benchmarks to see if i'm losing time and how much	0
for before and after	0
i see 7% proc use without multiprocessing version	0
113.7 seconds user time	0
note that down	0
how is that even possible	0
231.92 seconds user with multiprocessing	0
and twice the cpu usage	0
oh thats odd	0
i made 10 processes, idk why it's that slow	0
how many threads that thing is spawning?	0
oh	0
python is weird	0
i have 16 threads on this proc, and yet, only 2 of them were working	0
and it took twice as long	0
although there is no disk or network bottleneck, it only computes some numbers	0
i dont get it	0
hmm thats weire	0
no idea	0
go to libera #python	0
maybe i will	0
but i want to figure it out by myself	0
oh	0
nevermind	0
i am stupid	0
i forgot to delete the normal call	0
now it's somewhat faster	0
12 seconds to be exact..	0
compared to 113	0
seems more like it	0
now i need to go to 32 books from 10, and then write the first few hundred thousand to disk	0
this is going to be fun	0
does python have infinite integers?	0
got it	0
82 MB for 2 hexes	0
that means 41 MB for a hex	0
that means i can make 2490 hexes before i run out of space	0
oh ok, im glad it wasn't some crazy weirdness	0
ok, let's get to work	0
orangeFlu: it has infinite floats	0
does it?	0
float("inf" or something	0
that doesnt help me	0
yeah float("inf") or -inf	0
and i launched it	0
100% processor	0
it is a number that is bigger than all ints in python	0
this is what i like to see	0
but it doesnt help me	0
hahaah	0
not really	0
oh my	0
you have have ints that are bigger than float(inf)	0
inf is not a usable number	0
every language has that	0
i asked if there are infinite ints	0
what do you want to do with inf	0
nothing	0
it doesnt help me, it's useless	0
ah ok	0
it is a method of telling you, you fucked it up and have overflowed the float	0
i asked for big ints	0
for example, in haskell, if i add one to a 64 bit int, it doesnt overflow	0
it just keeps going	0
until it has an int big enough to occupy my whole ram	0
thats the limit	0
sys.float_info i guess	0
why do you keep suggesting floats??	0
you asked float overflow	0
there is also int_info	0
i asked for big ints.. mattf 	0
i can 10 ** 100	0
with normal ints	0
try opening a python shell and playing around	0
im computing the googleplex now	0
yes	0
it has big ints	0
hah it is stuck on the googleplex	0
i managed to succed in computing 54! a few years ago	0
it took a while on my old old computer	0
it is trying to compute a googleplex 	0
my god	0
the funny thing is, if i didnt have the thing at the top saying the proc is at 100%, i wouldnt have noticed	0
i give up	0
everything is going smoothly	0
python math's factorial seems to use the gamma function approximation	0
its gives results instantly	0
couldn't compute the google factorial :(	0
OverflowError: factorial() argument should not exceed 9223372036854775807	0
i mean, my pocket computer could do that with some pretty big number	0
but it's using floats	0
you cant just use ints on the gamma function	0
i'm on hex 51	0
2.2G	0
i'm tempted to stop it	0
because i found an optimisation	0
do you think it would be faster to compose a book in memory and write it to the disk at once, or write it page by page to the disk?	0
idk	0
with the fastness of nvme ssds, i'm not so sure it makes a difference	0
oha	0
https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython	0
Title: GitHub - RustPython/RustPython: A Python Interpreter written in Rust	0
wow	0
nice	0
yes	0
i should have used this	0
jesus	0
is it in the aur?	0
it's not too late	0
no but cargo	0
cargo can use git links :P	0
very interesting	0
might take the rest of my life to build this	0
well first one life to download it	0
i wonder how fast it is	0
well i think you are going to benchmark it soon :p	0
what am i going to benchmark?	0
rustypythno	0
the difference between normal python and rustpython on this app?	0
well yeah	0
nah, i'm already too deep, on hex 109, i will not stop it for the life of me	0
if it errors out, sure	0
but not until then	0
ok	0
my computer is in pain	0
you downloading it or compiling it?	0
compilling now	0
and i also have a windows vm running	0
close it ffs	0
and benchmark it	0
i am curious	0
you know what i realised...?	0
i fucked up again	0
well	0
you fuck a lot	0
not really, but i fuck up a lot	0
i am going to have to close it	0
FUCK!!!!!!!	0
ok, let's try with rust python	0
since i interrupted in anyway	0
hahaha	0
cool	0
not sure how full is their python implementation though	0
they claim 3.9 or greater	0
it doesnt need to be that full, i barely use the standard library at all, most of the program is normal arithmetic	0
but the whole stdlib is working?	0
for that might be fine	0
oh nice	0
build error	0
oh fuck im on the nightly rust i think	0
i think me too	0
i need the stable?	0
orangeFlu: how do i change to the lts one	0
yeah	0
rustup update stable.	0
rustup default stable	0
oh	0
is that just setting a global variable	0
i wonder	0
probably, but it also downloads it if you dont have it	0
and installs it	0
for me it worked	0
ah	0
this is a bit annoying about rust if you are just testing stuff around like i do	0
yes	0
couldn't you specify this on the toml	0
i think you can, not sure.	0
111 crates, jesus	0
yeah 	0
im updating first 	0
i ran update and it wants to update so better update	0
:P	0
updating what?	0
system update?	0
rust default	0
stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu latest update on 2022-01-20, rust version 1.58.1	0
rust stable *	0
for me it installed and it works fine	0
oh nice	0
have faith	0
now i need to figure out this jit stuff	0
yeah it was because i was trying to build with nightly then	0
ah, fuck	0
the jit doesnt work	0
oh well	0
it only works if your function arguments are ints or floats	0
and i exclusively have strings	0
you can still use it as a normal interpreter right	0
that works?	0
and as it turns out, it doesnt work with my program anyway, because as i had suspected, my program uses fork() which is not implemented by rustpython	0
if it wasnt for multiprocessing, it would have worked	0
oh multiprocessing	0
but oh well	0
change to threading	0
nah	0
it cant be much faster anyway	0
well who knows	0
i hadnt realized before, but i was only generating book from one shelf per hex, thats why i was going so fast through hexagons. Then I realized that i should have generated 32*4*5 books instead of 32 per hex	0
thats why i stopped the first time	0
where is handyc, he loves hexagons	0
he certainly will be disappointed when he learns how stupid i am	0
he is probably preparing for language soup	0
hi	0
hi	0
the program is running, handyc 	0
hanbtv*	0
cool	0
in about an hour it should generate like 50 gigs of books from the library	0
ha	0
i need more processing power...	0
if i could generate the books on the server and send then here...	0
i always wanted to make a super computer with many nodes and run things in parallel over the network	0
like OpenMPI	0
but bigger and better	0
because that was a bitch to work with	0

i wish my dad would have given me a raspberry pi to play with when i was small	0
truth be told, they didnt exist back then	0
but i will never forgive him	0
when i had my first computer i was 13	0
thats why i dont know how to use compuetrs	0
first conputer at my house was a 2865	0
.random	0
funny you remember your first computer! i cant remember mine, only from what my dad told me they got	0
i still have my first computer	0
me too	0
my personal computer anyway	0
i kept all my computer and phones from the first one	0
never could sell them	0
with one exception though	0
a computer i gave to my then girlfriend	0
she was too poor to buy one	0
nice boy	0
i ended up regretting it	0
.beer orangeFlu 	0
thanks	0
i do have some beer lying around	0
it's an IPA though	0
horrible	0
theres two beers i cant stand, IPA and Pilsners	0
yeah I hate ipas	0
don't like the bitter beer trend	0
hanbtv: at how many gigs should i pull the plug?	0
handyc: are we doing the thing later today?	0
hanbtv: whatever you like to be called	0
daddy	0
yes gasconheart 	0
orangeFlu: 1tb	0
i dont have 1tb	0
50gb	0
and we are going to wait a while	0
ok	0
i just did some small math	0
apparently, it would take more bytes than atoms in the observable universe to store all the library	0
orangeFlu: dumb factorial loop algo of 100000 takes 5.23 seconds in average with normal python and 1.85 seconds with rustypython	0
so there go all my dreams	0
oh, nice	0
i would have rewritten my program, i really would have, but the reality of it is, i didnt know if it would work even after using threads	0
i'm barely on hex 10 right now, it's so slowww	0
its like the babel library	0
thats the point, yes	0
i dont know why i just didnt generate random characters from /dev/urandom instead of using this slow algorith,	0
but whatever	0
handyc: you might want to try, on your genetic algorythm	0
you use simple python there	0
i only generated 7137 books so far...	0
hanbtv: handyc: https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython	0
Title: GitHub - RustPython/RustPython: A Python Interpreter written in Rust	0
and i can guarantee that if i search through them, i can PROBABLY not find even "i love you"	0
yeah	0
actually, let me do a script that searches through them	0
in rustpython	0
fzf the heck out of it	0
might be interesting to see the response times	0
thanks	0
ok, so it works	0
i made it	0
but	0
even with the fastest way of reading, it still takes a lot, and it's only going to get worse	0
right now, i have 13G of books	0
but it will be more until i finish explaining	0
if i search for "i love you"	0
it takes 25 secs with normal python	0
and it doesnt work at all with rust python	0
lets try that again	0
17 seconds with normal python, 30 with rustpython	0
thats not what i expected	0
mattf: explain	0
hah interesting	0
how did you implement the searching	0
initially, with mmap	0
but rust doesnt have it	0
so i settled for open(dfger, "r") as f: f.read.find(search_term)	0
its inneficient	0
but does the job, and for benchmarking doesnt matter	0
i also put the generating app on pause as to not increase search space between benchmark	0
i see, interesting	0
i could do something...	0
probably rustpython find's implementation is bad	0
but it would be unfair to normal python	0
i could modify the find functionaility in a separate function and write it with ints only, and JIT it with rustpython	0
you could also compile python with mypy	0
what is mypy?	0
might be faster than rustpy	0
like cython	0
i see	0
i could but that means installing one more thing	0
you could also try cython	0
idk this seems all like a big experiment anyway	0
my experiments always go out of hand	0
and become unnecesarily big	0
i already wrote more code than i wrote all day at work	0
that should tell you something	0
wrote, and rewrote a couple of times	0
also, i started to get a little error at some point, OSError: too many files open	0
which is weird, because after i write a book, it should close the file right away	0
and there are only 32 books open at once	0
but i skipped the cause and fixed the effect	0
ulimit -n 65536	0
we are at 16G!!!!!	0
cant wait to see how much i can compress this fucker	0
dont you find it amazing how we can generate so so much information with just some knowledge and a little artificially created language that bears the name of an animal?	0
and then search through it like it's nothing	0
i think i've already created more books than a man can read in his life	0
think about that	0
sounds like an advanced way to waste some time	0
it's really not	0
i am learning some stuff	0
yeah	0
every experiment is an opportunity to learn more	0
dont be fooled	0
12545 books right now	0
still no "i love you"....	0
i am very disappointed	0
it will never love you	0
it will if i try hard enough	0
maybe mattf	0
awww	0
so i generated randomly 17 billion characters so far and not one happened to spell i love you	0
fuck that	0
i will wait a few gigs more	0
i think i will let it run overnight if i dont find iut	0
it will stop at hex 50 anyway	0
mattf: do you want a book? i am selling them, 50 cents each	0
there may be wisdom in them	0
no	0
i dont have space	0
or nothing at all	0
come on, a book is like a few megs	0
ok, 10 cents each	0
ok, it's free	0
nah	0
still no	0
if you pay me i get it	0
you drive a hard bargain	0
ok	0
pay me 25 cents for each	0
how many do you want?	0
all	0
no	0
fuck	0
how much money is that	0
how many are there?	0
.wa 25 * 14625	0
(orangeFlu) Result: 365625 - https://is.gd/Il0C9u	0

ok	0
3k usd is fine by me, ill pay you more	0
you mean, i will pay you more	0
what happened?	0
the whole terminal crashed	0
yeah i couldn't know	0
it is just on your end	0
i figured	0
i should have done a smarter thing...	0
like make a queue and permit only 16 processes to run at once	0
this is a bit too much	0
for my poor proc	0
i figured that most of those processes will stay idle anyway while waiting for the disk to write them, but we are not in the HDD era, nvmes are almost as fast as RAM these days	0
hanbtv: guy	0
i made a build of my dumb game loudercake and gasconheart: https://github.com/matheusfillipe/godot-rpg-action-demo/releases/tag/v.01	0
Title: Release v0.1 · matheusfillipe/godot-rpg-action-demo · GitHub	0
in your first show it was my Skype that caused for you not to get any audio	0
damn	0
gasconheart: there was audio, just that it was shit	0
I had been getting an annoying message "update your Skype" by my Manjaro Linux, which I ingnored	0
no no	0
im with this guitar riff on my mind but no idea what song is it from	0
before that, orangeFlu 	0
one week earlier	0
before that, it was misconfiguration from hanbtv, no?	0
aa, i see	0
got it	0
Skype over Manjaro stopped detecting the microphone until I ran an update	0
it happened to me too	0
haha :) no, it was at my end	0
but with discord	0
oh!	0
oh	0
I found that out after that	0
and forgot to tell handyc	0
but i have an external mic, so dont really care if the internal microphone does not work	0
I will try from my laptop today then	0
ok	0
hex 25!! we reached the half point	0
what the hex	0
im trying to run cracked dark souls 3	0
hex 30 now	0
but we dont condom cracked software on this community	0
lol its not using my gpu	0
oh god	0
dwarf souls	0
wow the game is not a ram wormwhole as i thought it would be	0
gasconheart: where do i go with the chat? cant remember	0
for language soup?	0
orangeFlu: do you know a great tool to run an outsider .exe with proton	0
like you can just wine anything.exe	0
running with wine works but the game was not using the gpu	0
no, never tried it	0
protontricks is stupid 	0
but i read about it somewhere	0
it is possible	0
maybe with lutris or something like that	0
gasconheart: how do i use the COM thing??	0
playonlinux hah	0
com? sdf's com?	0
serial com?	0
sdf's com	0
orangeFlu: hi	0
Did you mean: How do i cum	0
orangeFlu: type com on their shell	0
there are no instructions on how to use it	0
then type h	0
orangeFlu: are you in SDF's shell?	0
just hit h	0
slowly	0
orangeFlu: in the SDF shell, type "com"	0
you might want to set your backspace key with -	0
what is SDF's shell?	0
hit - then backspace	0
oh	0
well	0
ssh to it	0
you have to open an account with SDF first	0
ssh to what?	0
then they email you the credentials so that you can log in	0
fuck sake	0
really?	0
yes, man	0
where can i find this SDF?	0
www.sdf.org	0
I think you can open the account on the spot	0
https://sdf.org/?join	0
Title: SDF Public Access UNIX System - Free Shell Account and Shell Access	0
at first you won't have many privileges, but com is one of the features offered to new members	0
http://sdf.org/?signup actually	0
Title: SDF Public Access UNIX System - Free Shell Account and Shell Access	0
and why do you use that instead of irc?	0
what is the point of this?	0
i met gasconheart and handyc there	0
its a pretty cool tui	0
com is a sign of identity for SDF	0
coded by our chairman	0
com is awesome	0
ok, i sshed 	0
now?	0
com	0
- hit backspace	0
h for help	0
g anonradio	0
space write your message	0
read history	0
Ctrl + U works	0
- hit backspace?	0
yes maybe your backspace key wont be recognized	0
what does - hit backspace mean	0
to enter "typing mode"	0
are you in COM alreafy?	0
yes	0
but you dont understand i dont understand what "- hit backspace" means	0
its gibberish	0
try to write a message	0
what is that minus, what does it mean	0
its always a key press	0
you have to hit space to start writting a message	0
if you are unable to delete then remember the - thing	0
this is like vim	0
you hit a key to start a mode kinda, but actually each key is a command	0
how did i get to anonradio???	0
i didnt type it	0
g anonradio	0
i'm very confused	0
list rooms	0
i didnt type that though	0
oh not really	0
g Return to list them	0
why is this so laggy	0
nothing makes any sense to me	0
it is a bit laggy yeah	0
me handyc and gasconheart talked only there for like 2 years	0
jesus	0
irc is much better than this	0
well this is lightweight	0
this is suckless too	0
say something	0
i dont know if it still works	0
did you type?	0
yes many people had	0
you are still there	0
if you dont see, quit and come again	0
nothing comes through to me	0
is it because i am still in message mode?	0
are you seeing your name?	0
yes	0
yes	0
just hit return	0
you wont receive in that mode	0
this seems so dumb to me	0
IRC is so intuitive compared to this	0
yeah of course, we are not comparing this to irc	0
this is something that 300 people or less in the whole world know about	0
most of sdf people are on their irc too	0
really? is this so exclusive?	0
yes	0
i can see why people dont like it, but damn, compared to IRC, this is almost extinction level	0
lol	0
can you see my ip here?	0
from the shell	0
maybe	0
this is all many users logged on a freebsd shell	0
ah you are on a different instance for non validated people	0
i dont know what that means	0
people can get validated 	0
then you get static hosting	0
and other things	0
static hosting?	0
for a site or what?	0
suddenly i dont understand half the words you say since you started talking about SDF	0
static page hosting	0
without cgi	0
website hosting	0
i'm on hex 39	0
does no one talk?	0
seems like i'm the only one talking	0
nice show, mate	0
if it werent for the tech problems, you would have had much more time to talk	0
you should aim to start at 21:10 max	0
:--)	0
i am on hex 49, let's goooo	0
hi guys	0
people seemed to like it, handyc 	0
hi gasconheart 	0
yes I think that one really came together well	0
   \o/	0
FUCK YEAH!	0
we have a pretty good back and forth	0
how do i validate for SDF	0
I can validate you	0
orangeFlu: handyc has the clearance to validate you on SDF	0
orangeFlu: there is also IRC for SDF	0
i like that handyc is calm and collected while gasconheart is kind of erratic	0
really cool blend	0
there are like two factions though, at IRC you won't find the same people that hang out at COM	0
you should be validated now	0
handyc: thanks	0
you're welcome	0
orangeFlu: irc.sdf.org then #sdf	0
it's funny you say that, orangeFlu 	0
because he brought notes and I was just speaking off the cuff	0
I thought I was the erratic one	0
he did?	0
yes	0
i couldnt have guessed	0
ha	0
he prepared all kinds of stuff	0
i thought he was just saying whatever crossed his mind	0
I think I was throwing him off his script	0
no I do not think do	0
so	0
yes, a bit, you were	0
i am more gascon's style	0
i prepare and then i just talk nonsense 	0
"nonsense"	0
orangeFlu: do come to irc.sdf.org #sdf	0
why	0
what is there?	0
I am talking to the IRC faction of SDF about you	0
why?	0
to pride myself I have a bright buddy!	0
you do have 2, mattf and handyc 	0
what did you say about me?	0
they dont seem very talkative	0
what is this SDF anyway?	0
SDF is a club, orangeFlu 	0
a club for computer nerds basically	0
it has been around since 1987 (!)	0
seems like a very restricted club	0
hm kind of	0
 \o/	0
HOOHAH!	0
anyone can join though	0
it is not massively advertised, that's true	0
they dont advertise themselves, and as far as i can see, they dont talk at all	0
sdf is an ISP and vps provider	0
and honestly .... not everbody would feel comfortable there	0
they do happen to have a club	0
I would say the other way around, mattf 	0
their legal status is as a club	0
easy answer to this: what were they first? an ISP or a club?	0
idk, but both parts are big	0
actually, now that you mention it, i did hear about an ISP named SDFD	0
some time ago	0
cant remember where	0
where is it based? Austria? Germany?	0
in 1987, when it was launched, it was a bulletin board	0
USA	0
Seattle at present	0
hmm, thats not it then	0
they do seem like secretive folk	0
haha no no	0
now, perhaps	0
maybe they are connected to the ARPANET	0
come in the mornings!	0
in the European mornings there is more activity	0
speaking of, i kinda want to sleep. Not really want, more like need	0
and its already 12	0
njsg talks a lot in the mornings, he is a great guy also	0
ooh	0
go get some rest, son	0
if i remember to connect to them tomorrow, we will see	0
ok, daddy	0
come to #sdf tomorrow morning, I'll introduce you to njsg	0
haaaaaaaaa	0
wowo hahaaaaa	0
!!!!!	0
mattf: remember njsg?	0
if i remember, usually mornings for me are full with meetings	0
oh yes	0
good night	0
oh :(	0
goodnight guy	0
"Nice job faking foreigner accents"	0
he said that about our show	0
good night organic fluids	0
njsg said that?	0
yes	0
did njsg ever listen to our show?	0
i think so	0
ooh	0

40 gigs	0
is the word love on it	0
i compressed it the best way i could, to .tar.xz, maximum compression level	0
it is now 20 gigs	0
i dont know about love, but i know "i love you" is not in it	0
let me check	0
yes, "love" is in it	0
how man ytimes	0
probably hundreds of times	0
maybe we have "what is love"	0
i dont know, i am stopping the search after the frist one	0
searching ...	0
i wonder how many universe ages would it take to write the code of the simplest snake game or maybe pong	0
but love being 4 letters, it is probably hundreds of times at least	0
you need much more characters for that to happen	0
and in what language?	0
yes that is the question	0
in ruby, probablt only a few years of a supercomputer generating them	0
"what is love" not found	0
baby dont hurt me	0
ok	0
im not asking you to search that :P	0
anyway	0
what did you learn from it	0
anyway? ok	0
anyway is on there!	0
how many vaginas does it have	0
i learnt about how to optimize my search algorithm in really big texts, and to make it more efficient, i probably should have put all the text in one gigantic file	0
it would search much faster	0
"baby dont hurt me" is not found	0
i wonder... if i took it all and put into one file, how much faster would it be	0
let's try	0
and now we wait	0
probably many hours	0
then i use the new search	0
and compare	0
cat the file and pipe to fzf :P :P :P	0
oh, its done	0
40 gigs	0
lets see what is faster	0
give me a string	0
nevermind, it doesnt work	0
i get a memory error....	0
that is to be expected i guess	0
i should do this more cleverly	0
for some reason, the "efficient version" already took far longer than the find() function	0

i may actually be a viking who knows lol	0
it does involve fixing printers and running a rather sizey windows terminal server env. but my main job is all thing unix	0
hello everyone	0
one of my first tasks will be setting them up with a free server monitoring	0
Ah good, but fixing printers still sucks :P	0
fixing crap others didnt setup proper always sux	0
Yes but printers are processed by demons	0
mail servers are worse	0
printers i learned i can just provision via GPOs	0
(fuck you, windows server. fuck you)	0
3D printers are much better than 🖨️ printers	0
Mail servers are horrible too	0
kind of depends on the printer in question as well	0
the ones we use at work are proper moon rockets	0
I can't get one that I manage to be able to send to hotmail	0
i think they're like 30 grand a piece	0
stupidly big, fast and quiet	0
Matricial?	0
copierprinterandwhatelsehaveyou	0
unsure what you mean mattf. these are just stupid large office printers	0
but i'm not too much worried about them, they seem to just work	0
Well that's ok then, i was wondering if they weren't those old noisy matricial printers that are still used in some places	0
My dad's store has one	0
nah. there is one of them (i think) in the backroom of the tourist center	0
but that hasnt been used for ages	0
at least there used to be one 5 years ago	0
anyways i'm here for the surrounding landscape more than anything else	0
It must be pretty	0
just breathing in deep outside basically is saline fine-mist inhalation which is proven to be massively useful to respiratory health	0
if that even makes sense	0
get much of the air up here = throat is fine	0
doctors usually send asthma patiens and such up here to catch a break	0
patients even	0
Ah yes, my brother is constantly using this salinizer device on dry periods	0
he'd just be golden around here	0
I guess that's the natural air there	0
just run up and down water front for a bit	0
handyc: what is this hanb mess	0
my parents dragged me up here (albeit to another island, which is like the other end of our island chain here) from 2years up	0

Btw i took some time to learn some cobol. That day you and elp talked about it gave me the inspiration. Well i just wanted to know what it was about	0
loudercake: how are we boy	0
now go apply for bank jobs and get fucking rich b/c everybody who knew cobol is basically dead by now	0
Hah i would never get in	0
pretty sure if you hit the right bank they'll just stop reading at 'cobol'	0
just put it up front	0
i know deutschebank and commerzbank in germany are kind of desperately looking for cobol programmers	0
Last month I failed on a data science job	0
Failed getting in i mean	0
well, thats how it goes	0
dust off & right on	0
i was chosen here b/c they knew me from before and even if you cannot imagine it 'from the top of your head' most people wont stay	0
i left after 5 months last time. but came back knowing what i was getting into	0

i dont think it will	0
the lead developer is much more involved and he said that he went trhough some rough times, but now is all good and ready to rock	0
oh hes fine again?	0
my impression was that he was old and dying	0
"In 2004, Volkerding announced via mailing list post that he was suffering from actinomycosis,[13] a serious illness requiring multiple rounds of antibiotics and with an uncertain prognosis. This announcement caused a number of tech news outlets to wonder about the future of the Slackware project.[14] As of 2012, both Volkerding and the Slackware project were reported to be in a healthy state again.[15]"	0

it just crashes	0
i can play with mpv but only vlc has dvd menus support (that i know)	0
i hear more and more vlc is failing to do something	0
and mpv is replacing it	0
vlc is still better in playing videos on my shitty lapotop	0
i ditched vlc for mpv for a long time now	0
better than mpv? 	0
yep	0
tho my laptop can only handle 720p max	0
btw you mean actual dvds?	0
yes i do	0
wow	0
i mean sometimes only	0
well launch it from terminal and see why it crashes	0
you could try AUR's vlc-git or something, your laptop is arch right	0
i dont have the dvd rn but it was some problem with a specif lib iirc	0
yes it is	0
i will try that later	0
loudercake: btw did you see	0
i played more dark souls	0
i killed the first damn boss	0
after 3 hours of trying	0
its a pretty easy game [	0
if you have enough time to memorize every move	0
it is not very different from trackmania 	0
:P	0
isnt trackmania just a car game	0
how do you compare dark sould with god damn trackmania	0
loudercake: trackmania isn't just a car game, it is a dark souls damn hard car game	0
but yeah it is much simpler	0
i mean, no crazy rpg things	0
btw i eat my own wordw	0
mpv is better than vlc	0
yes	0
i changed youtube-dl to ytdlp and it doesnt buffer at all	0
"eat my own words" idk if they say that in English though :P gasconheart check that out	0
i dont know why youtube-dl lags so much	0
not lag	0
like take longeer to download	0
oh really interesting?	0
never tried ytdlp	0
from what i heard its better	0
one cool thing i found out while doing the wcofun script is that you can pipe a binary output, like from curl, to mpv	0
thats the point of a damn fork duh silly me	0

not really in the true sense of the word, but it resembles it, in that the real people that have anything to gain are the first to sell, and the more they sell, the more this pyramid gets bigger. plus the nft games. Plus the fact that people can take anything and make an nft out of it, doesnt matter if its their art or not. Plus the fact that every nft is actually not on the blockchain, but on a 	0

we're just relaxing it	0
no, i am reffering to germany	0
your impression is wrong sir	0
just smoke a joint in front of a cop	0
well, i got weed very easily when i went to berlin	0
i recommend doing it in bavaria for the addon kick	0
well, sure, i wouldnt be that obvious, i'm saying that it's easy to buy, and if you are not very obvious about it, you are fine	0
availability does not relate to law	0
i never said it was legal 	0
theres places on earth you'll be stoned for smoking ganja but it just grows on the sidewalk	0
i just said easy to get, so therefore the law is not that strict regarding this stuff	0
no, that does not relate	0
availability does not inversely correlate with consequences	0
if that makes sense	0
eh i'll brb, going outside for a smoke	0
well, surely, if the cops care that much about it, then it would be much harder to sell and the availability decreases, no? again, not talking about consequences	0
no	0
because police focus shifts across country	0
get busted with weed in cologne, compare to getting busted with weed in like munich	0

or... actually	0
i got an idea	0
if i did the same thing but the iso was on a disk that is not in the lvm volume group, it might just work	0
wait, no...	0
that wont work	0

mattf you shot a duck in 2.893 seconds! You have killed 435 ducks in #romanian.	0
why would you want to know that anyway	0
in the tutorial you sent me	0
orangeFlu: it is tricky to get working, i sent you a link specific for ubuntu though	0
did you get that	0
it's not for ubuntu	0
it's for grub	0
you ddin't get the second link?	0
i did	0
oh right	0
yeah it is grub	0
please read carefully what i said	0
grub wont mount /etc/fstab	0
in the tutorial, it specifies where to find the iso	0
right?	0
idk what you mean	0
yeah	0
i did that once many years ago for slackware	0
didn't get working at first try but i know it is possible	0
the way it specifies where to find it and where to mount it, it uses the normal disk devices you find in /dev	0
grub doesn't know about that	0
and the onionshare thing doesn't work	0
problem is, my ubuntu doesnt use /dev/sda1 or whatever	0
i use lvm, so there is a mapping to be done	0
and i cant find the equivalent locations for LVM	0
isn't it possible to specify the device uid	0
it's not about the uuid	0
i found the uuid of the mapper	0
doesnt help me because i cant mount the iso on the loop device	0
because i dont know how to specify which loop device to use	0
loopback loop (hd0,msdos1)$isofile	0
this is what the tutorial writes	0
oh yes	0
where /dev/hg0 is the first hdd	0
that looks familiar	0
but for me, when i use a mapper, the loop is not there	0
it's in another device that i dont know how to find	0
to avoid this problem	0
i need to have a disk that isnt part of the LVM	0
so it has /dev/sdX mapping	0
you can try to drop into a grub rescue shell to explore your disks and see which is the one	0
there are many disks, i wont try each one	0
well that is hard then, can't you put the boot iso on every of them :P	0
or unplug some	0
 i cant unplug them, otherwise i wont even get to see the grub screen	0
some of them	0
this is the conundrum	0
i cant	0
i just said	0
how weird, well i never used lvm	0
well idk then	0
get a usb :P	0
do you have adhd?	0
oh	0
there is a mobile app	0
requires root	0
or not	0

there are android apps to turn the phone into a usb drive	0

it needs to be rooted?	0
then i dont	0
oh god	0

gasconheart though....?	0
that could take at least days	0

i'm going to try	0
on rehoboam	0
is it 26 valid characters?	0
so each new one is times 26 the time in average?	0
i think its base-32	0
so, every character srinks your odds by 32, or 2^5	0
that isnt to say you cant get lucky	0
thats a steep exponential 	0
but even luck runs out	0
yeah in average	0
so 5 sec for 6 characthers?	0
its not really an exponential	0
looks like 32^n to me	0

maybe i will get lucky	0
but you can be lucky and have it in 1 sec	0
sure i can	0
lets be hopeful	0
is that a gaussian distribuition?	0
i have 24 cores on the server	0
in what way? what are the axes?	0
ah, i see what you mean	0
yes, it is	0
chance of getting it by time	0
the mean is what you just calculated	0
roughly anyway	0
yeah i guess that it might be	0
we got that value not very scientifically	0
yeah	0
but what is the height of the gaussian at that point	0
meaning, what is the standart deviation of this thing	0
we should have made more runs with different values and time them exactly	0
you should make samples with less than 6	0
std deviation is not the height though	0
and we can model this	0
orangeFlu: no but if we know it we know the height	0
can you fit the model? i used to know how to do it with matlab but not anymore	0
s/meaning, what/which could be answered	0
which could be answered is the standart deviation of this thing	0
orangeFlu: if you make many samples	0
i can make you some runs, but!! BUT, i cant stop the program exactly when it finds one, i have to ctrl-c it 	0
there is some error there	0
no you should write a little script for it	0
whenever there is stdout stop 	0
or actually dont even stop	0
just count the time betwen \n's on the stdout	0
let me see if it has options to stop at the first find	0
would be easier	0
if you send me that data, i would model it	0
from 1 to 6 or 7 characters and all the times	0
how many each?	0
idk, the more the better	0
lets say you can leave it running for the night :P	0
ok, should i use "a", "aa", "aaa"?	0
well thats an interesting question	0
it is	0
since i dont know you should use a random character each time	0
we get into another exponential space 	0
ideally, i would use them all	0
like make a run with "a", then "b"	0
but that exponential as well	0
oh well yeah	0
by the time you get to 3 chars, you are fucked	0
just make sure they are random each time	0
ok	0
i dont think it matters	0

well leave it for another day or never :P	0
somehow the program doesnt do what i expect it to	0
probably never	0
it is just one of those useless things anyway	0
yes	0
i ask it to generate domains starting with aas, and it prints all the domains it discovers	0
very weird	0
worse than that, it behaves as expected in an window, and not in the other	0
the same program, same args	0
i'm too old for this shit	0
hahah i dont get	0
aaah	0
maybe pipe to | grep -e "^aas"	0
or something like that	0
thats gonna tamper with the measurements	0
because of print time to stdout	0
not an option	0
it prints the times?	0
no, but it prints every domain it tries to match	0
that slows down the program	0

did you guys just generate that gasco___ at random	0

do you use something to filter out the good ones	0

why don't you look in the library of babel	0

look for gasconheart	0
i could	0

oh, well	0
orangeFlu: putina reclama care o fac, fac reclama pentru trivia	0
ideally, this has to become (one day) a site to socialize in Romanian and to play trivia in Romanian	0
i could keep looking but i need my processing power for something else	0
difficult goal	0
in the meantime, everybody is welcome	0
and, most importantly	0
we have some by-laws, and here language will NEVER be a condition	0
mattf: although, my vps is going to keep looking, i will just put it in a screen session and leave it running	0
gasconheart: where are the bylaws?	0
never seen them	0
hm	0
perhaps "by-laws" is too much	0
hahaha	0
call them "rules"	0
or "suggestions"	0
or policy	0
in the main page, on the web site	0
you just defined by-laws :))))	0
i mean, are you banning people based on these rules?	0
if yes, they can be called bylaws	0
I don't recall we ever banned anyone	0
if i break an important one, would you ban me?	0
I would rather wait for a conflict between users to surface, then ban someone	0
orangeFlu: yes	0
then they are bylaws	0
being friends with an admin is not an excuse	0
yeah	0
i know, obviously	0
i think its very good that you have these boundaries	0
you havent hurt my feelings or anything :))	0
mattf: server reinstallation is underway	0

screen is good, if anything comes up, like a domain, i will send you the keys	0
i pay for the vps anyway, why not make it do some work	0
i will probably forget about it and in a few months, when i remember, i will check it out and have a key	0
what are the chances?	0

sounds great	0
so where the fuck are they defined	0
you should restart wayland	0
why	0
just for lolz?	0
to confirm	0
it's confirmed, it tells me in the error what they are currently bound to	0
they seem like default bindings	0
bound to?	0
oh	0
and i dont know where to find them	0
bound = past tense of bind	0
bound to 	0
bound to something	0
its a dangling participle	0
that they are currently bound.  ok	0
parse error. unexpected end of sentence	0
"they are currently bound to what"	0
its just a matter of shuffling words 	0
thats where the "to" comes from	0

if next cloud wants access to the ssl certificate, but the certificate is in the reverse proxy container.. how the fuck do i make them share it?	0

so how can i automatically toggle an extension on firefox startup	0

or delay it	0
i have no firefox extensions, idk	0
(another guy who doesn't want to fix my issue and im too lazy to do it)	0
mattf: i dont think you can parameterize firefox from the outside, i.e. via commandline switches etc	0
i'd guess it involves writing some config, then launching ff	0
yeah but maybe with a little extension	0
can extensions deactivate extensions	0
probably not	0
that would be fucking stupid	0
that would be very unsfae	0
and dangerous	0
and i run some custom js that can do that	0
yea, just throw all security precautions your browser offers for the plugin infrastructure out of the window ;)	0
fuck it, where we are going, security is futile anyways :-D	0

and you will be like oh my god	0
i bet we will	0
simple donuts are good	0
I have eaten so many donuts	0

from where	0
I think I could probably make a real donut	0
I get them at the grocery store	0
why make it in blender whn u can make in real life	0
basic common sense	0
how are you going to put the real life on in the game	0

mattf knows what this game is about	0
handyc: is that going to be an irc rpg bot	0
yes	0
cool	0
but mattf	0
here is the big problem	0
those color codes make the total packet size huge	0
so if you do different colors for each board item, it can easily trigger the anti-spam function	0
wow look at what I made like 3 years ago	0
well imgur hates me	0
https://i.imgur.com/75IlLUk.jpg	0
oh yes i still have the blend file	0
why is it wet	0
it is shiny	0
it is a stone board	0
https://transfer.sh/2OljL1/showcase.mp4	0
handyc: oh really? actually for a bot like that then i should remove the spam filters	0
if you are going to run it from your vps or has a static ip just give me and ill whitelist	0
mattf can do change the filters by channel	0
probably a static IP on digitalocean	0
idk if i can do it by channel but by ip yes	0
yeah	0
at least on dumb irc clients like mine	0
if you mean display a notification by ping	0
doesn't work on my client	0

i think that could be a monster for some game	0
that's pretty cool looking mattf	0
this monster would not have much room for a brain	0

noice	0
those emojis are wider, though	0
this will always be a problem	0
and I think Chinese characters are a different width from both of those	0
you remember that it wasn't already possible for a ches board	0
yeah	0
this depends on who is seeing	0
whatever font of who is seeing	0
right	0
so you can do like i did	0
make it configurable	0
mattf is there any way to force the client to interpret as a monospaced font	0
no	0
okay fine	0
but there is a way	0
"Please use DejaVu Sans monospaced, size 12"	0
:P	0
yeah	0
which is annoying	0
is there any standard about fonts in the IRC spec?	0
no idk	0
yeah, then the only other option would be to avoid doing anything on more than one line	0

handyc: stop pretending you are making a bot	0
I am making it	0
this is going to be great	0
i hope so	0
maybe my bot lib gets popular then	0
mattf this is going to be bigger than space quest 3	0
yeah it will	0
you could make it send images	0
and this place will get a ton of new people	0
yeah I could add that feature also	0
dont forget to add 🍩 as an item 	0
last frame	0
mattf I came up with some ways to automatically create objects	0
first it is easy to import all of the unicode symbols that look like objects	0
random.choice	0
but also taking any arbitrary image from a camera and using scaling and sampling to make it any size object for a game world	0
https://transfer.sh/NladiV/0001-0240.mp4	0
there is is	0
does that link work handyc	0
yes I see your eyeball monster	0
but here are some issues	0
the eyeballs are going to chafe wherever they touch as they rotate in different directions	0
@pt chafe	0
but the chafing patterns will be different depending on where each eyeball is in the eyeball complex	0
chant.  	0
scrape	0
you mean get hurt?	0
it is a flying monster	0
because each eye turns in a different direction	0
so the eyeballs will rub each other	0
yeah	0
also, where is the brain going to be	0
or is this a magic zombie	0
there is no brain	0
creepy	0
yeah	0
but it also can't do anything to you except look at you	0
with its cursed gaze	0
https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beholder	0
Title: Beholder | Forgotten Realms Wiki | Fandom	0
it would be a cool weak enemy for a game	0
the D&D beholders can shoot different spells out of different eyestalks	0
what is that	0
yeah, we could have that fox guy	0
level one he hits the bats	0
hah	0
level two he hits the eyeball monsters	0
then the game becomes 3D	0
yeah	0
that would be great	0
imagine a game that gradually envolves	0
and the whole goal expands exponentially	0
yeah	0
yes	0
like telling the history of games	0
that would be awesome	0
yeah	0
I had this idea a few times	0
totally possible on godot	0
And we would not need to finish them all at once	0
but you dont reuse much then	0
We could make some and then connect them later	0
yeah	0
but release as individual games	0
i think next we will do a platformer right loudercake 	0
good idea	0
the platformer envolves to the top view rpg one	0
commander keen is a classic	0
here is my idea	0
castlevania	0
let's do a club	0
and we meet up every so often and we all play a classic game	0
first it starts with a text based game	0
which is the one you are doing	0
then platformer	0
then the top view	0
my first pick is commander keen	0
and it ends with dark souls	0
for side scroller	0
Okay	0
:P	0
Well it has to be accessible	0
I don't know how to get Dark Souls	0
i mean the graphic level	0
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_Keen_in_Invasion_of_the_Vorticons	0
Title: Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons - Wikipedia	0
oh I see	0
it starts with something like pong	0
then text based	0
well it should end in a VR world where you feel like you are in the game	0
it is the history of games told in a single story	0
each level is a new thing	0
the history of all games or the history of digital games	0
digital	0
because it is a digital game	0
not really the actual story, it just progresses gradually	0
and has a single story that makes sense and can explain that	0
well you could even start with a classic game like chess	0
yes but wont make sense	0
and then the rules gradually extends and the game space and pieces are modified gradually	0
it could be a scify rpg fantasy, with 3 main realms which are different universes that explain the text based, 2D and 3D gameplays.	0
i wonder if you can make pixel art out of a 3D model consistently 	0
then the animations would look all alike and more could be reused	0
Should be able to	0
i think you would have to manually edit	0
why not just make actual pixel art	0

this is for my new game	0
it will bring many people to your chat	0
btw mattf do you know if there is a way to know more move_towards like methods	0
oh great	0
loudercake: what do you mean	0
I'm watching live poker at YouTube, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6rTyWYg5kM	0
more Vector2 methods?	0
move toward isnt necessarily vector2	0
oh nice topic!	0
haha	0
i think it is	0
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector2.html#class-vector2-method-move-toward	0
it is a method on vector2	0
ha ha gasconheart 	0
Title: Vector2 — Godot Engine (stable) documentation in English	0
hmm i think move toward would be useful in other non movemtn based scripts	0
loudercake: and you can use it anywhere you have a vector2	0
probably vector3 too	0
vectors aren't only about movement	0
the thing that method relies on is having a time delta	0
it will make the vector gradually change to another through time	0
btw the comments told something about distance_to()	0
yes i used that	0
he is doing some fancy math	0
how	0
is it overly fancy cuz sometimes im lost af	0
if you want the distance between two vecs	0
vec1.distance_to(vec2)	0
well a vector is just two numbers	0
a vec2	0
it describes a position	0
where do i add that in the script	0
hah wherever  you need the distance between two points? what are you doing now	0

oh you are just making the bat first time	0
i think there is no reason to use distance_to yet	0
oh i see the comment btw	0
i see	0
Jennifer Gott	0

Couldn't you do distance_to() on the sword hitbox, make it normalized and negative, and use that for the knockback vector? 	0
well the guy is saying where to use it :P	0
alright i finished 13	0
nah dont worry about that	0
(global_position - area.global_position).normalized() this one is also cool	0
this is for computing which direction the knockback is	0
i see	0
but that doesnt have the deacc	0
deacc?	0
deaccelerate	0
anyway, proceed to 14 :P	0

oh noooo	0

7700 is the super secret code for a pilot to tell ground control that the plane is under terrorist threat	0

all I want is a programmable way to define characters, spells, attacks, hp's, fp's, xp's whatever other attributes, write the rules of combat, then items, and various items types like weapons, or even a cup, with its attributes. Then after all the rules are written i want to create the plot, not chronologically, in whatever way i want, and it will check for plot holes, things that go against the rules i wrote before	0

I supposed they should use something like that for very complicated plots	0
yeah mattf I know	0
that's what I'm trying to do with hanb	0
or maybe they dont do very complicated plots because that doesn't exist	0
and no one would bother to check it	0
when it is complicated enough	0
well mattf what you are talking about is actually a complex problem related to logic and language	0
people are spotting characters that suddenly change clothes on movies allt he time	0
but im not taking the full problem handyc	0
because if you want to check for things like logic validity and soundness then you have to maintain a certain kind of rigidity	0
just the simplified version of it	0
but if you want to allow for literary development then you have to break rules	0
but what you are talking about does basically exit	0
exist	0
it's basically just a level and character editor	0
well kinda	0
well here is what you want I think	0
You want some system where you create any object in space and time	0
and then that object will always be tracked 	0
so that if the teapot shows up in scene 4 but it was cracked in scene 3, your software will account for that	0
I think what you should be looking for instead of RPG software is software for writing plays	0

Title: What is Continuity Editing in Film? Definition and Editing Techniques	0
https://dcmp.org/learn/33-continuity-script	0
Title: Continuity Script	0
it has to be a framework, allow me to add new attributes, like there are characters, items, places. Those are things that have logic tied to it. That can cause plot holes. For example places are tied to a map that are tied to time. A character shouldn't appear somewhere too far away in a too short period of time. Characters plot whole would be someone exists but was born more than 2 years after his father died and he is a normal human	0
with 9 months gestation time. And for items, well, items shouldn't be duplicated, and they have locations, like characters does. If im not carrying and item it shouldn't appear out of no where. 	0
but it is not only about those 3 things	0
I should be able to add more and edit them	0
the goal is to write the plot while coding the plot and checking if it breaks the rules, then optimize the plot and change the rules, and see whats happening and what is the best way	0
with something like this someone could make an AI that writes books	0

yes mattf I believe such things are already in use by Disney etc.	0
oh 	0
I don't know how advanced it is	0
i see the last link is interesting	0
but certainly they can fill in missing pieces based on a set of information	0
they constantly do	0
well basically a programming language to write plots	0
any programming language is already capable of it	0
well do you know Tarski's World	0
it's not the same as what you are talking about	0
but at a low level it illustrates the difficulty of the problem	0
.w Tarski's World	0

oh i see	0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXnkovPgqs	0
i dont want the whole plot to be evaluted	0
just the logical things	0
well if you made your own I would use something like Tarski's World as a model	0
you want to have objects and define events that act on those objects	0
maybe someday 	0
yeah	0
yeah but it's more complicated than you might expect	0
thats the definition of OOP isn't it :P	0
yes but this is a major problem with OOP	0
it's one of the reasons I really try to avoid OOP	0
no OOp is perfect for this and for most games too	0
okay if you think so	0
this is actually a very complex problem in language and logic	0
still want to hear why you dont think so	0
well you can do it in a very simple way	0
but your stories will be pretty boring	0
because they will have to avoid violating any restrictions	0
the goal of the thing is not writing the stories on it, but simply checking for plot holes	0
but yes you can generate a story like the man took the yellow teapot to the next room and the teapot was still yellow	0
it doesnt have to understand the character's dialogs	0
or hand movements	0
yeah I know	0
that would be an impossible thing	0
I think I understand what you are looking for	0
the real world itself barely simulates it	0
:P	0
well this is the problem, mattf,	0
the "real world" is always subjective	0
even for things like the color of a yellow teapot	0
that is why it's difficult to write what you want unless it's extremely rigid	0
you can say that in your software the teapot simply has a property called being yellw	0
the color is what it is independently of what you call it	0
being yellow	0
but that is not how "our reality" works	0
and that might be enough for that simulated world	0
because teapots do not really have a property called yellowness	0
yes exactly	0
at least you know it is not green	0
and that could be already a plot whole tht is voided	0
just like chess is a good military simulation even though it looks nothing like a battle	0
whole	0
avoided	0
yes	0
we dont have to solve the most complicated problem to have applications of it	0
I would use something like chess legality checking as a start	0
why not look at the code for a chess engine to see how it determines a valid move	0
and then just add more variables to that	0
instead of using 8 x8 board use 256 x 256 board	0
i dont even know what your points is now	0
you want to check plot elements for consistency	0
so take something like a chess engine	0
a chessboard is 2 dimensional	0
in space	0
your plot stretches across time	0
but then there are thing happening to the characters over time, maybe you want to represent those as a separate dimension	0
well my point is, a chess board might already a good enough simulation of a real battle for most problems we have in a real battle.	0
so I would take the basic idea for how a chess engine checks to see if placing a new piece is legal	0
you dont need relativistic chess to be able to win the battle	0
what I mean is that a chess board is an 8 x 8 matrix,	0
your plot can be like a long rectangle	0
where the beats of plot points are the pixels	0
so you could have a plot of length 512 units or something	0
and 8 units high	0
to represent different character arc	0
i think you are just high now	0
well you don't have to like my idea	0
you are trying to check for consistency of plot elements across time	0
so you can imagine this in a way similar to raytracing	0
you want to prevent the same object from showing up twice	0
you are on sticking to the theoretical hole too much, looking for the singel equation that is the root of everything, but that is humanly impossible to figure out. 	0
well here is the thing mattf	0
the kind of software you want, it's available over and over again	0
this product has been released in all kinds of ways	0
but the level that you want it to work at, probably does not exist as a consumer product	0
yeah	0
and even if you use the software that film studios use, you would probably find that it is not your dream software	0
well not in the way i want	0
so ultimately to do what you want, you have to make your own	0
it is not only for movies	0
it is some sort of computer assisted plot writting 	0
well they have AIs to do all kinds of things now	0
like writing sports articles	0
yeah 	0
if you start writting a plot with copilot it is very aware of it 	0
but this is dumb handyc	0
AI is for problems that you can't directly write an algorithm for	0
my problem doesn't need that	0
yes I know	0
but you should really try to get Tarski's World if you can	0
Much in contrary, i want to code what the problem is	0
yes that is an interesting one	0
https://www.gradegrinder.net/Products/tw-index.html	0
Title: Tarski's World	0
maybe when i decide to learn a new OOP language ill try that	0
i dont see a direct way i would profit from such a nerd thing that i might not complete	0
maybe typescript or C3	0
c#	0
could be a little api	0
the cool thing about OOP is that you can create templates handyc, and reuse code when you have so many children's of the same object	0
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Keeper	0
Title: Dungeon Keeper - Wikipedia	0
yeah I know mattf	0
OOP is very useful for some things	0
but those edge cases pop up everywhere	0
even for something as simple as making a dictionary, OOP can feel too restrictive	0
like the root type would be Object, and it has no attributes. Then we have the subtypes Map and Object (names might change) Maps can contain objects	0
yeah	0
you can do it	0
then objects's sublcass would be items, character, animals etc	0
and you can build the OOP world reusing methods as much as you can	0
well, you would have problems in cases like this,	0
let's say your character can be any animal	0
and an animal can wear a bely	0
and later you can check what type a thing is and calling a method on it, instead of having a huge switch statement like you have in C	0
belt	0
and a belt can have a pouch that you put animals in	0
you could have problems where things are infinitely parsed	0
it would be easy to accidentally create situations where details are parsed by the world forever	0
so you would need to have timeout rules	0
this even happens in Tarski's World	0
there is a proof checking function that has to time out sometimes	0
i believe the core object should implement containing another objects, actually maybe even the root of all classes on t his	0
because it's not possible to determine beforehand how long it will take to check an arbitrary proof	0
a puch that contains itself	0
pouch	0
well you would have that problem on any way you try to implement this	0
well mattf you realize you're basically describing set theory	0
math itself has that hole	0
it is the barbers paradox	0
yeah	0
but you can cheat around it	0
the goal of programming paradigms is not to prevent that	0
it is mostly writting a maintainable code base, there is not such thing that would make the logic behind a problem easier	0
yeah I know	0
but basically what you want is a character database	0
and then a small macro that checks it	0
kinda yeah	0
you are basically just describing a database that has tables for characters, objects and plot elements	0
and then just checks to make sure if someone was murdered in scene 2, he can't exist in scene 3	0
yeah you got the basic idea	0
so one basic thing you would want to check for is does this object still exist	0
i also want to be able to add logic to it 	0
if someone ate a banana in scene 34 then you can't use that banana again in scene 35	0
like "if you get this spell you die after using it 3 times"	0
i want to be able to code on things	0
so it is not a mere database, it is an engine	0
but the real problem is that literature is about breaking boundaries	0
so no writer would ever really want to use what you describe	0
maybe just to get some notes	0
yeah but thats not the problem i want to solve	0
there are some things like this though for tracking scenes in plays	0
but I think you would want it to track 10,000 objects	0
there is also the database aspect, generating family trees, checking ages of characters when they did something, searching and etc	0
there is this custom thing that is an "Act" i think that is another Root absctract class	0
but it is just a logical system	0
handyc: it doesn't have to necessarily handle complex things, it is just a consistent way to write plots logically. Track things that matter, and later check things like where characters are at the moment others are somewhere else	0
and at any moment you can poetic.license("Anything you want is possible")	0
and void the logic rules	0
that are shown when you try to comppile something inconsistent 	0
yeah but mattf	0
you have to write rules for all those things	0
and I think you will find that even doing it in a simple way will reveal unplanned complexities	0
the engine will have the basic rules and types	0
well here is the other thing	0
if enough things are defined already, then you're basically back to using a game editor for someone else's game	0
handyc do you seriously believe this is really such a complicated problem	0
you can't have both total flexibility and total automation	0
oh that is a valid point	0
mattf in some ways it's an easy problem	0
but in some ways what seems easy soon turns out to be very complicated	0
handyc in the end this thing is just a library that you are writting code for	0
so you can code anything	0
sure	0
like godot	0
it comes with thousands of classes and things to make 2d and 3d video games	0
do you know this game	0
http://www.deliantra.net/	0
Title: Deliantra MMORPG	0
but you could fork and and turn it into a video palyer	0
that is why it is a programming language for rpgs	0
it is like gdscript in godot	0
or python in blender	0
the backend is C or C++	0
python or gdscript is enough for most things you would want to do	0

no handyc, you know what i want	0
okay, well I was seriously planning to add this type of thing to hanb	0
so I can try to make it and see if you like it	0
add what	0
that type of logical consistency	0
hanb is one game, not a game creator	0
if you are willing to go all the way on something like that it is a big project	0
well I have been working on it a long time already	0
the type we should group to work with if we are interested on it	0
I thought we were already a group	0
no we never did nothing together	0

i fucking hate this shit	0
oh i dont like those strategy games 	0
i'd rather die more on dark souls	0
i spent a lot of time making everybody happy and at some point, my vassals suddenly decided they want to go to war with me, although they all had high opinion on me except one	0
what the fuck	0
i like them, but what the fuck	0
my vassals always want more land, my people always want less taxes, and my brother always wants more of my wife	0
handyc: dark souls is a real rpg video game, you choose classes, create your character, there are endless items, spells, weapons. Weapons degrade, food worn out, if you carry too much you are slow, there are like 15 attributes you can upgrade and level up and each time it is harder and you need more souls. Souls are the money, every living thing has many souls because it is the actual currency. it is sorta a medieval apocalypse word	0
reign by dragons that attack randomly and you are an undead yourself. Im not sure what is the plot yet	0
well mattf	0
D&D is the original rpg	0
thing is it is extremely hard, you need both strategy and reflex and die until you memorize what to do	0
GURPs is based largely off D&D	0
not denying that	0
or GURPS	0
so probably if you could find a digital implementation of GURPS	0
you would still have to figure out ways to check for consistency across time and all that	0
but it would at least give you a popular generic framework for fantasy worlds	0
I wasn't say dark souls is any close of the Real Plot eGine language	0
the currency really doesn't matter, it could be souls or doggy bits or diamonds or candy hearts	0
RPGL	0
im going to #linux on freenode ask for this now	0
i am sure i did this before	0
mattf, let's say your rpg story takes place on a 2D world, inside a circle	0
thats simple enough	0
if you wanted to talk about a sequence of events in that world over time, it would create a tube of finite length	0
it might be enough to have a 2D map	0
that tube's length would be time	0
perfect	0
so let's say each character in your world is a dot	0
lines	0
over time	0
what you want is a system that makes sure all the lines in the tube are consistent	0
and do not break or double	0
wel handyc	0
unless if i code teletransport	0
but lets say that is all i want	0
well that's what I mean about edge cases mattf	0
in a simple scenario yeah	0
thats all a want	0
if you have a world of magic it's difficult to track consistency	0
is there any inconsistency with that model ??	0
but if your world is very boring	0
if you say that the entire world is basically a hollow tube filled with hair	0
handyc: that is why it is an engine, not a computer program	0
then you can generate consistency by generating all at once	0
and just having time as a separate space dimension	0
so if you want a 3D world then just make a 4D tube	0
well you could imagine each object being described by an equation for a curve	0
positions on a N dimensional space isn't everything	0
positions doesn't always have to mean spatial positions	0
you could use this to map out plot points also	0
it doesn't have to be continuous	0
for example, you could have a graph of a character's attraction to another character over time	0
something like a family tree	0
i dont want to model such thing	0
you could have a map of how much kingdom A hates kingdom B over time	0
thats some sort of continuity i dont need for my problem	0
or you could have a map of how much kingdom A hates kingdom B based on how much gold kingdom C has	0
thats another problem	0
well think of it this way	0
if you can create the basic idea of what you want as a chessboard	0
and then generalize it, you have what you want	0
chess has 32 characters	0
it is a small 2D stage	0
a play is just the relationships of the characters over time	0

mattf welcome to the new hanb	0
I am not even calling it hanb anymore	0
that is just the code name	0
project hanb	0
mattf here is how the new hanb works	0
there are 64 levels to the universe	0
each level is represented by one of the following characters:	0
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789_.	0
a is a quantum foam particle	0
b is what I call a Planck particle	0
each character is exponentially larger than the last one	0
so . is an entire universe	0
A is coincidentally the exact same as the Angstrom	0
so that is the size of most atoms	0
a-z are basically just radiation	0
then B is molecules	0
O is a town	0
P is a province	0
Q is a continent or a moon	0
R is a planet	0
hah	0
and you can create a universe by typing a string	0
so you can type Zjkdhlkjh.	0
. is the multiverse?	0
and it will evaluate as one Z type, one j type, etc.	0
and then you can evaluate them down to the number of levels you want to process	0
it is starting to sound like a thing that does absolutely anything	0
. is a complete universe	0
well mattf here is the key	0
it doesn't do nothing, but what it does it very simple	0
*is	0
the basic idea is just this, 	0
and what it does is?	0
a 'b' board contains 'a' units, a 'c' board contains 'b' units, etc.	0
the basis is a remapping palette,	0
that re-evaluates any value as a new board matrix	0
so if you give this function a byte value between 0 and 255, it will return an ordered set of 64 byte values	0
that remapping is controlled by whichever genes are in favor at a given time	0
and also by random chance	0
is that willing to be a game	0
yes	0
that is what I am still working out though	0
I can generate any kind of object this way	0
but then I have to have some kind of interaction	0
like enemies that chase you	0
here is what I will do next,	0
it should have the classic game elements like gathering gems	0
fighting monsters	0
getting gold	0
getting XP	0
HP	0
MP	0
interesting	0
here is how I am currently thinking about some basic elements	0
you can have 3 maps,	0
animal, vegetable, mineral	0
animal would include any game monsters and also animals you could hunt for meat	0
vegetable would have trees and any plants	0
mineral would be gold, rock, mountains	0
with that you can cover most ordinary objects	0
so for example a metal spoon is just a small mineral object	0
if you want larger things then just use a larger map	0
but you can't have interaction between two things past about 3 levels	0
that sounds like a game now	0
but is getting very complex	0
in hanb, you start off at one level in something called a situation	0
a situation is an arrangement of tiles on the board	0
the situation is determined by the palette rules for the previous level up	0
so for example you have a town and you want to look at a neighborhood	0
you click on that neighborhood which is only 1 pixel in the town	0
and then it becomes 8 x 8 pixels	0
based on the remapping	0
in the town map it will have a value from 0 to 255	0
and then there is a map that says, 0 returns this particular matrix, 1 returns this other matrix	0
there are many more possible matrices than there are palette values	0
so these change over time	0
dont you think that is getting very complex	0
well I try to reduce complexity as I go	0
and eliminate things that are impossible to do	0
the game actually gets smaller and smaller over time	0
but in scope it has gotten larger and larger	0
soon I will put this up on github	0
it's really getting close to a real thing now	0
I tried to use standard categories for certain things to make it all easier	0
otherwise it would be too complex	0
cool, looking forward it then	0
I use a 61 cell hexagon board or a 64 cell 8x8 rectangular grid for everything	0
with inspiration from things like chess, D&D and classic card games	0
well, you say it is just a game but the idea is actually to do this kind of generic world modeling	0
I want to learn as much as you know about blender and that stuff	0
but it's difficult for me to find the time to do it	0
if my wife is awake and she sees me doing it then she gets mad because she thinks it's just doodling	0
hahaha	0
but you are	0
if I do it when she is asleep then she gets mad at me for staying up late	0
you might not get any money from it	0
well art is important mattf	0
nor ever finish those ideas	0
time is too	0
imagine what would have happened if someone like Socrates would have just worked for money	0
ok socratres	0
My point is that it's important to do non-productive things sometimes	0
yeah that is not wrong	0
but your wife also has a point	0
no, but mattf you don't understand	0
and doing non-productive things is "doodling"	0
she doesn't want me using blender at all	0
she would not want me running the program at all	0
well you could make money with blender	0
yes I know	0
look at the prices for cgi arts	0
but I have to learn to use it first	0
im thinking on selling that house	0
yeah	0
:P	0
and I have a background in art	0
it's not like I just started drawing	0
I am not a professional, but I have been doing art stuff my whole life	0
yeah	0
mattf I had this new idea for an app	0
im bad on it but i spend the time	0
too many ideas no results!	0
I was thinking I could do hand drawn art with crayons	0
:P	0
oh god	0
hahahaha	0
mattf you are impatient	0
"niec grafics!"	0
think of how much progress we already made	0
no donut yet though!	0
I will send you a donut	0
I told you, things have been busy	0
The guy is coming tomorrow to switch our Internet	0
oh cool	0
i hope we can have starlink here soon but my dad will have to pay tht	0
insane price for me	0
mattf	0
did you hear about the starlink satellites	0
falling down yeah	0
40 out of 49 satellites burned up	0
thats nothing, he wants thousands	0
well there are 1 thousand and something already	0
well, he has the money, okay	0
oh really	0
I didn't know there were already so many	0
okay	0
i wish i could see their falling stars	0
wow, what a crazy world	0
it is	0
i admire this on elon musk	0
I bet I end up eating at a Denny's on the moon when I am 80	0
he managed to sell a game he made when he was 13	0
or so	0
yeah	0
he knows how to make business	0
thats how a man should be	0
not using blender and doing art	0
thats stupid	0
close that thing	0
sure	0
I could easily be rich now from working	0
but that's dumb	0
you could not could you	0
not like those guys	0
and not like 100th of those guys either	0
and it isnot that dumb if you really can	0
because once you do you can spend the rest of your life with the things you like	0
the truth is we all wanted that, if you spend 20 years to get there you are done	0
you still have a lot of time to do thinsg you like	0
well, here is the thing	0
but managing to control yourself, having that discipline	0
not easy	0
part of what Elon Musk did is brilliant	0
not dumb	0
part of it was being in the right place at the right time	0
and cashing in one thing to do something bigger	0
so he is definitely a genius	0
I think it takes a lot of skill to become someone so huge	0
yeah	0
but it's not that difficult to just get a low level of wealth from working at a job like software development for 20 years	0
but here is the other thing	0
for most people it is	0
I have met a fair number of rich people	0
not people as rich as Elon	0
but people with a few million	0
and many of them are miserable people	0
natural	0
often because the money was all they ever did	0
so I would much rather die with less money and have lived a more meaningful life	0
yeah that is also a valid point	0
compared to dying wealthy and the only thing people can say about me is that I became wealthy	0
thats people who just worked and did their job and nothing else	0
my grandma is like this	0
but I still would like to get rich	0
I think if we focus on a few simple apps we can get some serious money	0
who wouldn't	0
nothing is easy	0
these things like wordle are very popular	0
yeah	0
people always love language and puzzle games	0
and they are easy to code	0
something a dumb think like that becomes popular	0
so we should focus some effort there	0
it is dumb to code	0
but i dont think it is because it is a word game or so	0
yeah but if we made one it would be easy to make 1000 variations	0
there is a lot of promoting and advertising behind those things as well	0
so you make a wordle, a scrabble, a crossword, etc.	0
it is not like a random poor guy did it and now he is a millionare 	0
well don't think too much about the adverstising part	0
you have to know the business as well	0
and thats why we are poor	0
we can always spend money on adverising later	0
no, but mattf	0
it's also a free for all	0
is not like just spending money and magically making it popular	0
you can enter the market with a good product and people will use it	0
no, spend no money	0
just make apps	0
i am not a social person at all, and thats why i am a failure	0
i should have spend less time learning physics on my teenagehood and got drunk on the parties	0
that would actually help more today	0
but still	0
no mattf	0
we know how to make the apps, doesn't mean they would be successfull 	0
even if it is an amazing idea	0
mattf I went to some of those parties	0
they are a waste of time	0
even if you used google trends, twitter api, make a deep sociology api, then spend millions advertising	0
there is still luck	0
but you wont know until you try	0
yes	0
well mattf I am going to start freelancing a bit	0
I need to prove to my wife that I am not a loser	0
hah	0
but I will work on the games stuff on the side when I have time	0
seems like you wont have time	0
such is life	0
one thing i know	0
you cant get rich freelancing	0
well, what choices do I have	0
I either get a full time job or do my own company	0
I am already legal to run my company	0
own company could be an approach	0
a good one	0
because it is freelancing in the right way	0
you are not just some dude that knows stuff, like i am	0
what do you mean	0
what kind of dude am i	0
you are a more formal freelancer, you can have a specific business and legal, but risks are still the same as freelancing	0
im talking about a company compared to freelancing	0
well one major advantage is that my wife already makes money doing translations	0
so it is not an emergency for me to find work	0
but if things go well there is no restrictions for a company	0
how much it can grow	0
legally we can hire employees	0
but logistically it can be difficult	0
as a freelancer you will just be a dude doing things that another dude gets the job for	0
so we are trying to learn Dutch and get permanent residency as soon as we can	0
well, my idea is basically this,	0
yes but you are "a software developing company" not "a dude i know can code that script"	0
do some freelance jobs over this year,	0
and turn it into a company	0
that will generate a moderate amount of income	0
gradually	0
i would think like that	0
and then develop my github projects during the same time	0
and try to do more interviews with larger companies in a year when my Dutch is better	0
shoudln't be that hard for you to land a job	0
if it is what is left for me	0
but sounds like a plan	0
The Religious Studies degrees throw a lot of people off	0
but I don't have any regrets	0

do you have glasses by any chance	0
gasconheart: i want to be able to change the topic. can we do that, please?	0
i dont	0
how is cloudflare able to differentiate two machines under the same LAN, using the same curl command to fetch a page with the same headers, but for one it is never blocked and the other is	0
cookies?	0
same curl command, no cookies. 	0
orangeFlu: sure	0
mattf or me can change it; suggest one	0
orangeFlu: avem alt vorbitor de româna	0
doesnt curl use cookies anyway? like you dont need to pass it cookies or anything	0
then if i add a debug proxy like mitmproxy or charles on the machine that is is blocked and it works! no longer blocked	0
it does cookie management	0
orangeFlu: you can use cookies or mimic anything a browser does with curl	0
its just headers anyway	0
yes, but	0
doesnt it do it automatically? like it adds the cookie headers and whatnot	0
point is, it works in one, it works on my vps's, it doesn't work on my arch machine	0
transparently	0
and now i just found out it doesn't work on my mac vm either	0
catch the packets ith tcpdump and see what the difference is	0
gasconheart: cine?	0
no curl wont do things like set cookies or collow redirects, run js and so on	0
the mibbit user	0
it is just a boring one request one response thing	0
but still allows you to build a scrapper	0
mattf: i know it doesnt do js, but cookies i am not sure about	0
gasconheart: mibbit? 	0
well you can set cookies	0
mattf: i am not talking about what you CAN do	0
i know you can 	0
but what it does transparently to the user	0
no you have to script everything if want, what do you mean transparently to the user	0
gasconheart: niciuna, eu schimb topicul	0
mattf: transparently to the user = without the user managing cookies manually	0
the user of curl doesnt realise cookie management is happening	0
and curl does it behind the scenes	0
orangeFlu: mibbir este o platforma web pentru IRC, acorda prefixul mib- la utilizatori	0
orangeFlu: iti dau @ ca sa schimbi topicul, hai	0
there is one request and one response orangeFlu, you use curl to build scripts. You can set and capture cookies that the web server is sending	0
mib_abf1vv: Buna	0
but for this request there isn't cookies actually	0
gasconheart: thanks	0
Buna!	0
even if you go with a normal browser, cloudflare is doing something shady	0
mattf: use tcpdump, see whats up with the packets	0
i dont know how shady it is	0
mib_abf1vv: si orangeFlu vorbeste româneste	0
mattf: there is something that it takes into account that i cant figure out	0
IP is the same, the MAC doesn get to it, the request headers are the same	0
what else is there	0
gasconheart: oarecum vorbesc si eu, da :))	0
yeah idk	0
it might be doing something on low level tcp	0
foarte bine, orangeFlu :)	0
or, if you have wireshark, all the better	0
but if adding a proxy makes it work... then thats it	0
what low level tcp	0
idk	0
with the http proxy exactly the same thing is sent from both machines	0
"low level tcp" is just the packet with a small header that has some checksums, window sizes and flags, its the same for the same request	0
HTTP has the important stuff	0
well then idk how it knows the difference if it is just http	0
for fucks sake	0
just send me the captured packets	0
i will look into it	0

oh true	0
surely ip blocked...	0

but you might able to fill a captcha or just whatever cloudflare does	0
didnt need to	0
it just worked on the browser	0
i dont know, maybe just use a user agent and some other stuff	0
nor really	0
i tried different uas	0
look in the browser to see the exact request and copy the headers	0
thats my method for doing this thing	0
there are more than ua	0

oh, nvm, you already have those	0
i just saw	0
sec-* stuff	0
then open the script and 	0
comment 25, uncomment 26	0
comment 27 uncomment 28	0
let's see..	0
and then it works	0
should i try or are you sure it works?	0
no pls	0
try it	0
im not sure	0
yes, worked	0
two results	0
of course this is for an anime site!!!!!	0
how could i have guessed	0
now i am uninstalling these packages	0
this is how i keep an unbloated system by the way	0
how you explain that	0
what is the proxy doing	0
i tried the older version of curl ubuntu uses	0
on arch	0
still same problem	0
what magic is that	0
it cant be just http	0
honestly? no idea mate. is your proxy adding headers? most do that	0
if i copy the curl request from mitm and run it, first it is the same one, and it doesn't work	0
hah just in time	0
the "copy curl command" from the proxy is also blocked	0
it is magic!	0
it is not just http	0
it has some lower level method, is what i mean	0
btw is there some other proxy, mitmproxy is a debugging proxy, that wouldbn't be needed, just some other lightweight proxy is enough	0
and a debugging proxy most specially shouldn't add headers or change the request	0
so it is very weird thing i found out today	0
i just spend the half day now with this problem, i stop bothering now...	0
what is below HTTP? TCP and IP layers. It cant really be that, theres not much info there besides the IP and some flags and stuff. Then you already get to Ethernet and frames, which contain a lot of identifying information, but they dont get past the router anyway.. so????	0
but im very curious, i guess only a clouflare engineer woudl know	0
IP layer is almost empty	0
really not a lot there at all	0
so explain that	0
believe me, i am trying	0
you can launch mitmproxy, it is a tui	0
i still need to see those packets, i swear to god	0
or you can use tcpdump and compare now	0
:P	0
well, i need access to the proxy, no?	0
where is the proxy	0
mitmproxy is a local proxy	0
it is a debug proxy	0
what?????	0
like charles, fiddler	0
you are running this on localhost:8080	0
this is getting more confusing	0
thats what im saying haha	0
ok then...	0
you are not using a external proxy	0
this is on your machine	0
i need my wireshark then	0
you can run mitmproxy, it is a tui	0
i got it from "is a local proxy"	0
but then comment like line that makes my script call it	0
kinda obvious what you meant	0
remind me to take a look tomorrow	0
i really want to sleep	0
uncomment line 27, comment line 28	0
launch mitmproxy	0
i am exhausted and drunk	0
well fine but you helped me to prove curl has some problem with cloudflare	0
and a proxy helps	0
if you copy the curl command from teh proxy there is nothing else than the original curl	0
and it also doesn't work	0
i will dissect this when i wake up	0
cloudflare knows how to do something we are not aware of, thats for sure	0
if i sleep now, i should be awake in like 10 hours from now	0
we will see then	0

im doing great too	0
I will say something about this	0
In American English we have a form of you called "y'all"	0
i know	0
and I used to hate hearing it	0
because it sounded uneducated to me	0
but then I took a course in Ancient Greek	0
and because Greek has more forms of you than English, all of these professors were using "y'all"	0
in order to distinguish from other "you" forms	0
so then I gained an appreciation for "y'all"	0
and then as I thought about it more, I gained a better appreciation for vernacular forms in general	0

the linguistic elements of country speech are fascinating, I think gasconheart would agree	0
did I say "rub shoulders"? :)	0
I think I meant "elbows", hahahaa	0

don't Brazilians say "rub bellies" or something?	0

I heard "rub bellies" from a lady from Rio de Janeiro 25 years ago	0

I am no salesman, by no means	0
I did her a favor... If I sold one, I would have gotten some $ that's all	0
it's because the key to sales is having the gift of gab	0

wwell orangeflu boobs are mostly for the male straight viewers	0
i highly doubt most hollywood boobs are for lesbians	0
i feel like a movie that shows boobs and dicks and vulvas and butts is balanced, and it should be normalized	0
agreed	0
or you know	0
everything is too sexualized right now	0
not have sexual stuff	0
well, no, there is a paradox here	0
if you dont have sexual stuff	0
What makes something sexual	0
it becomes more taboo	0
and then they become more sexual	0
and people get more aroused	0
How can you determine if a scene contains sexual content	0
just watch a god damn porno if you want to see boobs and vagina so bad	0
the same with how women used to dress, when men would get a boner if they saw only their shoulder	0
in 18th century or so	0
So does the degree of sexuality in a scene depend on the viewer's perception of the scene?	0
absolutely	0
there are some cultures in which boobs are not inherently sexual	0
yeah	0
there are still a few uncontacted cultures on Earth	0
in real life, people see boobs and dicks all the time. On the internet, in real life, whatever	0
many of those places that still live a premodern lifestyle, there is not much clothing	0
yes	0
this is the same reason i think it should be legal to walk around topless as a woman, in the same areas as men can	0
then you remove slightly more of the taboo nature of it	0
its a hard transition	0
that i can say	0
because men at first wont do anything but stare and make women uncomfortable	0
humans often cover the areas of their bodies that have openings	0
but if enough women do it, it will become normal	0
especially openings that secrete fluids	0
boobbs rarely secret fluids though. Most often the mouth, nose, urethra and skin secret fluids, and of those, only one is covered	0
i wonder if masks were around for hundreds of years mouths would become intimate	0
probably	0
depends on how much of your time you spend without masks	0
Jain monks use masks like the surgical masks	0
they have been using them for hundreds of years, maybe over a thousand years	0

and? is it considered shameful to how your mouth in public?	0
show	0
the monastics wear masks because they do not want to harm any creatures or influence the world in any way	0
the Jain belief is that karmas are physical particles	0
and they do not want to harm air dwelling beings with the air coming out of their mouth	0
they do not want to generate any karmas that bind the soul to the world	0
In Jainism the soul is a physical thing about 2/3 the size of the body	0
the karmas bind it to the world	0
so they do ascetic practices to burn off karma	0
interesting	0
so its probably very frowned upon to remove that mask, or worse than that, it's offensive to their religion	0

wow mattf really did sleep late huh	0
gasconheart: Hi mattf	0
Hi mattf	0
And hi mattf	0
someone call an ambulance	0
some straightjackets	0
 mattf: i took a look at the packets	0
something is denitely weird	0
i dont know why, but say i use your script without proxy, it makes a request directly to the wcofun or whatever it is called	0
loudercake: have you finished 15? That's really nice	0
and it resolves to a specific IP, obviously	0
orangeFlu: Yes?	0
but when i use the script with proxy, the domain resolves to a different IP	0
every	0
fucking	0
time	0
the packates look different, but they are under https, so cant say exactly what is different	0
Oh the domain tesolvesbti a different ip? How freaking weird	0
point is, the destination IP changes and as a result, the apckets change as well, not sure if this is the only thing that changes	0
because they are encrypted, i onyl see random bytes	0
its very weird	0
Isn't that because you first hit cloidflare and then get redirected to the real site	0
well, you would have to hit cloudflare in both instances, no?	0
When it fails you only hit cloidflare, which might have many ips	0
Yeah on both instances	0
which means while looking at the packets, at least the first few ones should be the same	0
the same IP	0
And they are not	0
What the hell the proxy is doing that curl by itself doesn't	0
orangeFlu. Btw if you try from a Ubuntu machine it works with plain curl	0
At least on the 2 i tried it is still working	0
i'm sorry, what?	0
Test it!!!	0
this is fucked up	0
Yes!!!	0
ok, testing on rehoboam	0
This is amazing	0
You can just copy the search curl request from mitmproxy	0
Or you could use this script to get their animes btw	0
wcofun -d attack on titan	0
And it will download all	0
But let's see if my hypothesis is true	0
So I tried to downgrade curl to the same version on arch. Still didn't work. But isn't curl just a frontend to libcurl?	0
Could be a on whatever .so it uses and then both old and new versions are using it	0
cant find htmlq on ubuntu	0
But here is another thing. The script worked until 2 days ago. Then they changed the site a bit	0
what is it called there	0
cargo install htmlq	0
i dont hae rust on rehoboam..	0
You can download a built from their github	0
fuck sake	0
cant do it on rehoboam, sorry	0
i will maybe try on my VPS	0
https://github.com/mgdm/htmlq/releases/download/v0.4.0/htmlq-x86_64-linux.tar.gz	0
There	0
Or just do a curl request. I can show you what it is	0

Super Bowl = the final match of the American football league	0

orangeFlu: indeed on ubuntu's curl it always work, then i built the latest curl on ubuntu without brotli and it didn't work! brotli is for the br encoding/compression type. Even though you set on the headers not to accept br seems the site still sends it, maybe it is part of cloudflare's testing if it is a real browser or something. So if i build the newest curl with brotli on ubuntu it works, without brotli it is like what happens on	0
what?	0
arch. 	0
it kinda makes sense	0
mattf: interesting	0
loudercake: yes, but how is it a joke	0
orangeFlu: Then i went ahead and built the old brotli on arch linux (1.0.7 and arch has 1.0.9 nowadays) and built curl statically to that. And guess what? I didn't work still! goddamit	0
thats no bueno	0
so maybe is not brotli at all but on my ubuntu builts if i remove it, then it stops working	0
this is fucked up	0
oh yes	0
the mistry goes deeper	0
i mean it should be enough just to not accept br on the request	0
i'm sure the answer is there is a bug somewhere and some unexpected behaviour happens	0
yes	0
would be cool to have found a bug on curl, or brotli	0
brotli is google's	0
get that bountry money	0
not really, but at least would have found a bug	0

i just came to terms with it and went back to the computer	0
thats the joke dumbass	0
go drink milk	0
i have some ideas to implement	0
loudercake: dont speak like that to your elders	0
i dont have milk	0
i have almost nothing in my fridge	0
welp	0
there is nobody here rn	0
cool	0
only you and i in an desolate irc void	0
well im here	0
this reminds me about the "dead internet" theory	0
i know i dont count but	0
oh hi mattf	0
oh hi mark	0
i toguth you were asleep	0
this is the time i wake up	0
the theory that most of the internet is actually just bots, and there are very few people you interact with, if any	0
interesting, but also nonsensical	0
the world is	0
ken are you a real person	0
loudercake: Yes. Are you a real person 	0
everyone else besids me is a npc	0
ken no	0
loudercake: Then who are you 	0
they aer not even there while im not interatcing with them	0
to save cpu resources	0
mattf the internet kinda makes interactions weird	0
i mean, look at ken, could you mistake that retard for a human? he has a lower iq than that of a dead person	0
orangeFlu: Have you ever met the wizard of oz 	0
people just become text	0
the typical romanian girls gasconheart bring here think ken is real	0
mattf: And what's your favourite song 	0
ken: fuck the aborted fetus, by cannibal corpse	0
mattf: I don't like it why 	0
i dont know if the romanian girls that come her are humans themselves judging by how stupid some are	0
Mystique seemed smarter than average though	0
wel, shes an x men	0

you know rick and morty and the butt face people	0
i would like some blussy right now	0
yes	0
and boob world...	0
yeah	0
but i mean, boobs in isolation are not that awesome, they unfortunately need to be attached to someone	0
kinda ruins the fun of boob world	0
they can be separated in real world too	0

Looks quite cool	0
it is very fucking cool	0
much better than htop	0
Brodie Robertson makes a video about it almost every day :P	0
you can even set the refresh time in the upper right corner	0
i dont know who that is	0
A linux youtuber with an annoying voice from Australia	0
and it has so many settings to customize it or to make it work on non truecolor terminals	0
Yeah you can change colors i think	0
you can even use more standard chars	0
so it looks ok on all terminals	0
It just didn't look so good with my huge fonts :P	0
i think it uses braille chars now	0
I use a fork of htop with vi like bindings	0
btop has vi bindings too apparently	0
its in the settings	0
Btw did you get my msg	0
It was libssl	0
yes	0
interesting	0
file a bug report and the fix you found	0

ah, yes, i know robie, just didnt know him by the name	0
brodie	0
fucks sake	0
even with his name on the screen i cant remember it	0

i dont mind his voice at all	0
also, the gcc and libc and binutils all got updates today	0

I watch him everyday	0
so everybody is fucking updating their packages like there is no tomorrow	0
i got like 100 updates today only	0
Oh god	0
i -Syu'd yesterday, and today 100 updates	0
I'm gonna wait	0
also, linux zen 5.16.9 update came	0
probably the same for mainline	0
so a lot of fucking updates	0
I see	0
I'm not ready for bigcyodates right now	0
I'm still on my phone :P	0
Haven't waked up at all	0
if it makes you feel better, it didnt break anything for me	0
but you have more updates than me	0
more packages*	0
You have a darn minimalistic setup don't you	0
Yeah that's the advantage of that	0
its not really minimalistic per say	0
i just tried not to install every little thing	0
because it gets out of control	0
i could have kept htop, but i uninstalled it for btop	0
not really a minimalist would do, but 	0
You uninstalled htop?	0
i minimize useless ppackages that i dont use	0
yes	0
That's being debloated at least	0
yes, i think debloated is the right word	0
i dont want to spin out of control	0
I will rarely run pacman -R	0
and keep things clean	0
i run pacman -Rns	0
better for cleaning up	0
mattf: my Manjaro laptop detects the mic sometimes; most of the time it does not; I found out it is *not* a Skype-specific thing	0
Oh maybe it is pulseaudio sucking as usual	0
 search for the mic or laptop online and see who else has that problem and how they fixed it	0
as much as puleaudio sucks, it doesnt control the mics themselves, just does something with their input	0
i dont think its pulseaudio's fault here	0
gasconheart: You are talking about the laptops integrated mic or sime external USB mic? Did you check dmesg, journalctl? Did you try restarting pulseaudio and also?	0
the laptop integrated mic and an external USB mic	0
Both fail?	0
yes	0
You don't see them on pavucontrol?	0
the one you plug directly to the jack seems to work fine, although it is the one I use less	0
I see them there, yes, sir	0
They are still not listed by Skype?	0
Skype does not list any of them	0
You always see them on pavucontrol but they are not listed by Skype or other applications?	0
i do not think its pulseaudio	0
Or is it just Skype?	0
I restarted pulseaudio alongside the hole laptop, may times, I suspect that is part of the explanation it works sometimes	0
well, I often record my voice with sox	0
for my quote unquote podcasts	0
and sox does not detect them either	0
not always	0
:tldr sox	0
  sox 	0
  Sound eXchange: play, record and convert audio files. 	0

when it does, the sound is horrible	0
hah, manjaro goes brrr	0
but,	0
How do you specify the input device to sox	0
when the laptop itself is just on its battery, the recording is nice	0
Oh	0
That makes sense	0
if the laptop is plugged to the power, the sound is just horrible	0
But poor design	0
poor electrical design it seems	0
it makes sense? hm; it was *not* like that on my 32-bit Debian laptop	0
because of coil whine and unclean electricity	0
oooh :(	0
But that was another laptop	0
I understand	0
It is not manjados fault	0
Manjaro	0
right	0
the electricity that the mic uses first goes to other components, and if those are designed badly, they will not give good, clean, without noise electricity to the mic	0
therefore bad sound	0
of course, the bigger the current/voltage, the more accentuated are the design problems	0
its not really something you can fix, unless there's a problem with the power source, in which case you could conceivably change it and it MAY be better	0
but no guarantees	0
how old is the laptop and what price did it have when you bought it?	0
I see	0
the laptop is pretty new, I bought it like, when?, 4 months ago?	0
5?	0
price?	0
and model, since we are here	0
price? about 300€	0
Lenovo	0
model? beats me	0
very weird	0
lenovo = good brand, 300 is respectable	0
and its new	0
loudercake: hey?	0
Hi	0
oh hi	0
did you get thelink	0
loudercake: you wanted it simple: http://ix.io/3PDD	0
Mattf thats not what i want	0
yeah but start with that instead of putting signals where it doesn't make any sense	0
what do you need that is different from that	0
Ok so i dont think you get what i want	0
I want the character to move tile by tile	0
you want it to do skips?	0
send me an example	0
video or so	0

Its kinda hard to see	0
But the character moves tile by tile	0

loudercake you befriended a duck in 23.664 seconds! You have made friends with 98 ducks in #romanian.	0
on that example he is not using actual physics like move_and_slide	0
hes setting the position manually	0
but i have an idea, we can try to snap to the closest position after the physics plays	0
i think i convinced my brother to try manjaro	0
let's see what happens	0
well i did that with gasconheart a few months ago and see where we got	0
yes, but my brother doesnt have any linux experience	0
just like Linus, he wants to try a linux but is not sure he has the time	0
and he will probably be bad at it	0
I think im just overcomplicating it mattf	0
loudercake: well you dont want continuous smooth movement	0
that is a valid point	0
i think i found a simlpe way	0
i think you can also just lower the resolution a lot to get that effect 	0
How do you "snap" to the closest point?	0
but thats a dumb solution	0
ill send you soon	0
Ok	0
Thanks	0
Its also how game maker charactrrs move	0

Its also how rpg maker charactrrs move	0
i'm going to join you very soon	0

Did what	0
The movement?	0
loudercake: http://ix.io/3PGN	0
Well thanks mr lead programmer	0
try it out	0
I cant rn im doing some chores	0
this way you can keep the high resolution, keep the physics and have the snapped movement	0

mattf you befriended a duck in 8.747 seconds! You have made friends with 435 ducks in #romanian.	0
ok im done with me chores	0
im going to test your code	0
awesome!	0
also how do you know this stuff?	0
i knew you had played around with godot some time ago but wow this is kinda advanced	0
don't rush, keep learning every day, and most important on computers you can try out and fail many times	0
but that is what you want now isn't it	0
oh	0
thats not really what i want	0
i want it to be tile based but i want the movemnt between it to be smooth	0
hah	0
isn't that the same of being all smooth loudercake 	0
when does the skip happens then	0
loudercake: you want the player to smoothly move between tiles but when you stop moving it smoothly snaps to the tile it is closer?	0
its meant to skip smoothly	0
add a if input_vector == Vector.ZERO:	0
and put the position = .... lines inside it	0
then only when you release the keys it will snap	0
loudercake: you can't smoothly skip, you either skip or smoothly move :P	0
ok so when you stop moving its meant to just keep moving smooth until it reaches the tile	0
ah	0
ok that makes more sense now	0
loudercake: http://ix.io/3PH0	0
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector2.html: Note: In a boolean context, a Vector2 will evaluate to false if it's equal to Vector2(0, 0). Otherwise, a Vector2 will always evaluate to true.	0
that is handy	0
so that will not smoothly snap but will snap, depending on your tile size is not noticeable	0
but if you want to smoothly snap	0

mattf you befriended a duck in 3.546 seconds! You have made friends with 436 ducks in #romanian.	0
loudercake: http://ix.io/3PH4  smoothly move and smoothly snap to closest tile. There is a problem that if you dont press long enough it will snap back to the same tile and not even move. That seems to be harder to fix but maybe you want this behavior or for the values of acceleration and speed you use it wont happen.	0

i might be, my grand grand mother from father, grandma side was native	0
i have some relatives that look way more native like than I	0
mattf so uh	0
i think there has been a misunderstanding	0
its not meant to snap	0
snap means go to some position	0
there are only some positions that it can be at	0

mattf you befriended a duck in 2.848 seconds! You have made friends with 437 ducks in #romanian.	0
loudercake: did you test the last code	0
gasconheart: i did	0
yes	0
very interesting	0
loudercake: that is smoothly moving and when you release it will smoothly snap to the closest tile	0
if that is still not what you want, i think you have seen enough to try to implement what you want yourself	0
do you know how do i figure out how this rounding works	0
loudercake: what do you mean, the rounding i did?	0
yes	0
round function will round to nearest integer	0
3	0
5	0
and so on	0
thats the round function	0
play around with it on a python shell, it is the same thing	0
(aka type python on the terminal, then type round(2.2) hit enter)	0
it is a good way to learn things you still dont understand	0
now how do you round to the nearest multiple of 2 or 3? How do you round up to the nearest multiple of N using just that round function that doesn't take more arguments	0
but whats the second value	0
snapped_round is a function i made, it takes this "multiple of what to round by"	0
you can see it bellow using round	0
now think if you wanted to round a number by its nearest multiple of 10. for example, 364 you wanted to be 360, 213 you want to be 210	0
isn't that the same that round does by divigin the number by 10	0
like round(364/10) will be 36	0
round(213/10) will be 21	0
do you see what i mean loudercake ?	0
so it is just a matter of doing round(number/10) * 10 to get the right number	0
and in fact you can replace anything, that anything is our tile size	0
that is all that function is doing	0
i see	0

ok mattf	0
you got it?	0
Faptul ca nu mai am? :)	0
i want the snap to be relative to the input vector	0
loudercake: try to do it, fail at least in 5 different ways and then come ask me why it isn't working :P	0
and what was your idea	0
so you know how the snapping goes back if you dont go far enough	0
yes	0
Mystique: what do you mean	0
i tought that making it based in input vector would fix it	0
well try it	0
but it gives a division by zero error	0
when i do snap_size_x*input_vector	0
that vector can be zero	0
(0, 0)	0
that is not where it is failing	0
i know	0
but even when i did this	0
if oldit == true:	0
ax=input_vector.x	0
ay=input_vector.y	0

ok	0
mattf: where the heck is the location of the WhatsApp pictures so I can sftp them to my PC from inside Termux??	0
i think there is a whatssap folder	0
from termux you have to cd to your storage	0
yes bu, where exactly?	0
I did	0
the pictures are *not* there	0
that's the problem	0
/storage/emulated/0/WhatsApp	0
thats the path on my case	0
and Media is inside that folder	0
I added a symlink to /storage/emulated/0	0
on my termux home	0
no /emulated under /storage here	0
that is what I want to do, to add symlinks	0
this is driving me crazy	0
well can you ls /storage	0
no /emulated under /storage here!!	0
I can	0
then explore	0
I've already browsed everything under /storage	0
I did	0
that's why I am asking the experts	0
do you have 0?	0
not either	0
hmmm	0
what phone is it	0
I just bought it lask week	0
I surrendered to the pressure of the masses	0
the masses of smombies	0
man i mean what phone model and brand	0
idk, it is a Sansung	0
idk	0
maybe you have /sdcard	0

oh	0
listen	0
cd /     does not list anything	0
or  ls /	0
yeah you dont have a rooted phone	0
I don't have permissions, it says	0
it is not rooted	0
so you are not root	0
same as linux	0
but I always could sftp the WhatsApp pictures from Termux to my PC, always with non-rooted Android devices	0
I always could do it	0
yeah just as you can do without root in any linux machine	0
if you find the right path you can do it without root	0
I know	0
/sdcard?	0
that's why I am looking specificaly for the path	0
you can still cd to them	0
ls /   gives an error message: "bitch, you don't have permissions"	0
why are you still telling me that	0

(mattf) Mamonas Assassinas :: Mamonas Assassinas was a satirical Brazilian rock band. On March 2, 1996, the plane in which the band was traveling crashed into the Cantareira mountain range, near São Paulo, causing the death of... :: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamonas_Assassinas	0
tragic story	0
god damn!!!	0
they started as a serious rock band, they were good but they saw it wasn't going to work out	0
I left Uruguay in 1996, they were still active!!!	0
I am listening the Senegal song. It sounds very very nice!!	0
then they started making parodys and funny stuff with those lyrics	0
I am shocked!	0
mixing many brazillian styles with rock	0
and they made their first album	0
I'm in shock	0
big hit, they were on all radios and tv channels	0
they got popular very fast	0
they were going to go out, to Portugal for the first time	0
and their plane crashed then	0
they all died	0

so tragic	0
for a comedy band yeah	0
for anyone	0
it is ironic i mean	0
oh yes	0
hey mattf, Daniela Mercury useses "negao" a lot. However, whenever I tried that word on a real Brazilian.... it turned out ugly	0
what are the socially accepted rules for that word?	0
it means nigger 	0
:P	0
then, how come Daniela Mercury gets away with saying it ... ?	0
actually no, nigger means Nigerian doesn't it	0
it is not a bad word here	0
it means "big black"	0
black guy	0
strong black guy	0
yes! literally, "big black (man)"	0
something like that	0
yes, yes	0
:P	0
not a bad word here	0
can I call *you* negao, mattf?	0
what is considered bad is calling someone black 	0
"preto"	0
oooh	0
if you say that it is bad	0
I see....	0
the correct is "negro"	0
ok, soooo good to know	0
so negão is just a cute augmentative of "negro"	0
the other day a Brazilian guy came to deliver a mattrass	0
the correct would be "negrão"	0
I almost called him "negao"	0
and then they use "negão"	0
so good to know	0
well dont do nothing stupid goddamit	0
not more than you already do usually	0
many Brazilians work delivering things here	0
hahahaaaaa	0

at some point someone will be able to say "i've told you! ive told you! you didn't hear me!"	0
yes	0
by pure chance	0
and the world really ends	0
well not the world	0
maybe most of the humans	0
i would be so valuable if most humans die	0
as an engineer	0
i know how to build so many stuff	0
so much stuff	0
i see	0
problem is you would be dead too	0
probably dead	0
but i'm near ukraine 	0
so yes, i would probably die	0
yeah	0
i'm going to sleep	0

2026 one is lame	0
what?	0
the doomsday prediction for that year	0
well the classical asteroid ending isn't it	0
I have an airplane game idea for this	0
anti asteroid force	0
some thing collided with the moon ears ago leaving a lot of high speed asteroid clouds that the earth is now facing	0
・゜゜・。。・ ​ ゜゜\_0​< FLAP F​LAP!	0
your goal is to remote control a stratospheric hypersonic plane to intercept the asteroids  	0
.bef	0
loudercake you befriended a duck in 46.525 seconds! You have made friends with 99 ducks in #romanian.	0
but in the end you find out that it was china who exploded part of the moon	0
then asteroid hunter 2 starts	0
why vibeo gane political?	0
it is ww3 but the countries are using nuclear weapons to launch asteroids on each other and clamming it is all natural disasters, and using nuclear weapons to explode them without it reaches the ground	0
it is like ace combat but in very high speeds, she ship is launched like a rocket that breaks the sound barrier while still on the launch and reaches mac 20 at 100k feet	0
cool	0
then you have to take care not to burn the plane on the reentry 	0
that sounds bonkers	0
in a good way	0
yeah then you approach those asteroids while they are burning and entering the atmosphere, because you can't always reach them while in space, and you have to destroy then before they are too low or reach the ground, because you are equipped with nuclear fusion weapons	0
so you have to climb and turn on the exact proportions to arrive in time to arrive	0
and bigger asteroids will break apart in multiple parts that you have to blow again individually until they are small enough to be destroyed by their own speed and atmosphere 	0
or until they are small enough not too cause too much damage or tsunamis and so on	0
well thats just modern asteroids with an attempt of a plot :P	0
and ace combat like gameplay	0
and asteroids hunter 3 would be space fights where you control multiple ships since the excuse is this all remote controlled anyway, and the terrorists are trying to bring a big asteroid to earth and you have to intercept this	0

his former friend that got pregnant randomly	0
she came from another city, i was the weird without friends but had the best grades	0
she wanted to study with me, we did that alone until the fatzo that was bullied joined us too	0
getting pregnant is actually not a random event at all	0
the fatzo and I were into her and we had this little group for 1 year	0
next year she became super popular and perverted	0
handyc: virgin mary?	0
and got pregnant from a 21 poor guy	0
my parents asked if the kid was mine	0
was it?	0
damn, my man	0
she would call my mother "antie" 	0

(gasconheart) There is no duck! What are you shooting at?	0
damn	0
lol	0
yes	0
btw i build openssl1.1.1f for android and it doesn't pass the clouflare test	0
curl	0
how do i list rust toolchains btw	0
like aarch64-linux-android	0
thre is a rustc command	0
rustup toolchain list	0
you almost wrote the command when you asked the question	0
i dont have rustup	0
well i guess it is just a shell script	0
then how the fuck did you install the toolchains and how do you manage them	0
i guess it wont screw up termux right	0
it is on termux	0
btw it might be the same names as my arch anyway hah	0
oh the rustup script totally want to make some mess	0
nah when i was cross compiling with "cross" it talked about a rustc command	0
do you know my good friend Lola?	0
what did i cross compile?	0
htmlq	0
this	0
rustc --print target-list 	0

what the fuck are you going on about	0
where do you see .loli as a tdl	0
oh it is tld	0
read the link again	0
oh i dont	0
would be cool	0
but lolis would be better	0
i need something	0
cant figure out what	0
how can i get rustc to stop being stupid and figure out what architecture it should build to	0
i dont know how to cross compile if thats what you're asking	0
search online	0
im compiling ont he phone	0
armv7-linux-androideabi seems to be the one	0
BATIA TOKER IA TIKTOKER	0
rust has a cool tool for cross compilling called "cross"	0
cargo install cross and have fun	0
OH, NICE	0
but termux sucks	0
for building rust at least	0
connect an external keyboard	0
well for aarch64 seems easier	0
im sshing to my phone	0
you just use the normal port or what? install openssh-server and ssh to it like you would on a computer?	0
yeah	0
interesting	0
i have root but i use the default 8022	0
so not the normal port	0
cause you need root for that	0
you can change the port	0
i dont have root	0
there is a /etc/ssh/sshd_config 	0
for well known ports i need root usually	0
like 22	0
yeah	0
or anything less than 1024 i think	0
yeah that is right	0
trying to build this crap again	0
im talking with a guy that uses emacs on his phone on #termux	0
libera	0
emacs on termux?	0
yeah failed again	0
yeah emacs on termux	0
but emacs is an X11 application	0
thats wrong in 2 ways	0
emacs -nw 	0
boom	0
emacs works on the terminal	0
and you can run x11 on termux	0
you guys are underthinking about termux	0
you can make shell scripts that call people, display notifications, little dialogs and so on with termux-api (besides using gps, and doing who knows else)	0
but the x11 thing is a hack that requires a vnc app	0
still for linux nerds, even though without root, termux is the thing	0
you can run a arch container on termux	0
with termux-boot and termux-services you can make ssh, tor, any script you want start with your mobile at boot	0

oooh right	0
you told us	0
yeah if you aren't receiving it is already off, didn't it tell you it shut off?	0
only thing is, this might overload the server a bit if too many people use it, but it's not really a problem in the meanwhile	0
thats why it expires 	0
cool	0
but im still testing that	0
so did it expire for you gasconheart ?	0
type 30 messages from now: nobody say anything	0

no	0
but the numbers didnt appear either, is this intentional?	0
when the thing is on the same language or the translation is the same as the thing then it doesn't do nothing	0
which is kinda bad for babel yeah	0

all of yours auto translate rules were cleaned for this channel! 	0
my understanding is that this should be like a thing that lets you chat in a different window where everything is translated to your language. So it would make sense to still write the numbers or whatever else to the chat anyway, so you don't miss messages if you look there only. Otherwise you have to keep your eyes on two chats	0
meh but might be ok for now	0
hmm not quite	0
if it waslike that the bot would have to talk for you in the original chat	0
you can already use auto if you want to do that	0
but it crowds this chat	0
and makes it hard to read	0
this is a much cleaner alternative	0
talking through the bot?	0
idk	0
no, the auto translation	0

@auto off	0
all of yours auto translate rules were cleaned for this channel! 	0
well true	0
but not totally	0
thats why the translated message is idented	0
:P	0
since the translations are not perfect is good to see the original too	0
so it would be cool if you could use that window to totally translate everything, and you could type into it, translate backwards and post it to the original chat	0
ok, babel translates any language to it	0
ok i will add that	0
handyc: what do you think?	0
but you need to set the destiny language somehow	0
well, you set it anyway, no?	0
no	0
babel translates anything to what you passed to the command	0

you could	0

make it @babel ro en	0

i was going to suggest that, yeah	0
or it could ask when you first talk with it	0
I like the idea	0
for Profilq for example, it would make things much easier	0

There is no install button	0
what do you mean :P	0
oh you launched the GUI and there is not an easy installer like ubuntu, mint and so on????	0
Yeah	0
if you are still on grub just boot to the first thing, live mode or wahtever	0
Then?	0
go for Manjaro instead, loudercake :)	0
now if you are already on t he live desktop interface and they didn't put a install thing on your face bad job of them!	0
loudercake: how are you?	0
loudercake: did you recreate the partition table and formated?	0
it worked? your hdd is ok?	0

You just recommended me this without even testing it yourself	0
yep	0
never used this	0
How do i rcrete the partition agson	0

Uh oh	0
It straight up cant write	0
hey mattf 	0
can you try to open a terminal and type: pacman -Syu gparted	0
loudercake: ^	0
gasconheart: yo	0
Im on gparted	0
damn	0
did you go to create a new partition table?	0
at users' request, and with my agreement, and if you agree as well; can you add the nick "Mystique" to be able to run the !skip command at the #trivia?	0
I couldnt	0
It cant write	0
gasconheart: she has to be an admin for that i think	0
oh man; you're busy with gparted..... no rush, mattf	0
mattf: I think there is a list of nicks in the code that are allowed to run !skip	0
loudercake: what is the error	0
on the details	0
paste on pastebin	0
anyway; later, tomorrow, when you have some free time, could you check that? thanks	0
it cant FUCKING WRITE	0
loudercake: there has to be more details duh	0
also let a terminal running: sudo dmesg -eHw	0
Input/output error during write	0
and you might see an error there	0
there has to be more details 	0
Its the same error from last time mattg	0
I think its a lost causr	0
there are no details	0
gasconheart: she has to be an admin for this i think, or the second level of admin, is that fine	0
loudercake: run the dmesg command and try it again and see the details there	0
you can also try journalctl -xef	0
and sudo dmesg -eHw	0
Mind if i keep yelling?	0
yes	0
ITS THE SAME ERROR FROM LAST TIME FOR FUCKS SAKR	0

that doesnt make sense you dont even have any partition there is there	0
Well its checling	0
you are getting that error when trying to create a partition table?	0
not when trying to format	0
Its already formatted	0
ah ok	0
maybe you shoudl have used ext4 there	0
but idk if it makes any difference	0
for this check	0

similar case	0
gasconheart: why is it so slow	0
is your connection, or because the container is slow	0
is the container slow for you on the shell	0
i can add her to admins gasconheart, i could do some weird hack so she can run skip only	0
but that would be a weird hack i wouldn't like to do	0
admins can run some things...	0
but we can make her an admin anyway	0
gasconheart: come on you were here just now	0
mattf: I don't know why it is so slow....	0
mattf: listen	0
/query gasconheart 	0
 	0
hah	0
dumb erc	0
I have just checked, it is not being op which allows me to run the !skip command	0
I remember now that you made a list of nicks allowed to run the !skip command; do you remember?	0
check the office	0
oh is there such thing already	0
I thouoght we can add Mystique to the list, until we have many regular visitors, so that she (or anyone for that matter) won't play with an advantage	0
Well mkfs.ext4 worked earlier so im hopefu	0
you ran both?	0
ah	0
mkfs	0
Earlier	0
well this is the case of an hdd with bad blocks, basically parts that you cant use anymore	0
the disk checking is so that it will know to avoid the bad sectors	0
Umm	0
but it also means it is dying	0
Is that fixable?	0
I mean	0
but it might be still usable, but be aware it is dying, actually any hdd is sying anyway	0
i think it is	0
after all windows was working 	0
After the command ends	0
lets see	0
Is it gonna be fixed or?	0
What even is this command	0
that should make it aware of the badblocks	0
avoid them	0
i just exlpained	0
Yes but	0
Where does it save the " hey these blocks bad"	0
thats a good question	0

nooo	0
"oxen"	0
irregular plural	0
no, the oven is what they used for the jews	0
ah, you said oxen	0
shit	0
yes, ox	0
I said "oxen"	0
handyc: why is that the plural	0
explain yourself	0
language doesn't always make sense	0
hello Mystique 	0
Hello, mattf	0
how are things there?	0
hi mattf 	0
handyc and I just did the show	0
you are not notified for PM's gasconheart?	0
I think I am, mattf 	0
hmm	0
oxen	0
oxen, brethren, kine, plurals with the -n ending; there may be others	0
probably because they were used for such a long time and we so integral to society, the word took on a life of its own	0
emacsen	0
emacs!	0
the plural of Emacs, the editor/thing, is "Emacsen"	0
yes	0
that does not look like an english plural	0
there are many emacsen	0
yeah ive never seen that	0
and i use emacs	0
I would think something like emenks	0
it sounds horrible	0
it may be wrong	0
I hope it is wrong	0

I hope it is wrong, because it sounds horrible	0
.wa what is better emacs or vim	0
(mattf) No results.	0
clearly emacs	0
here is a question for you mattf	0
that is a dumb question	0
what would you imagine the plural of data to be in english	0
Mystique: do you also hear fighter jets these days over bucharest? or is it just me?	0
datas	0
:P	0
doesnt data not have a plural?	0
it is a trick question, because data is already in the plural	0
yeah	0
The word emacs is sometimes pluralized as emacsen, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs	0
if i had to imagine it had one i would imagine datas	0
Title: Emacs - Wikipedia	0
Datasen	0
Nope, orangefluE :))	0
datum in the singular (seldom used), data in the plural	0
so words ending with this "cs" sound have an en plural?	0
isn't 'en' german plural	0
well the 'cs' can go to 'x'	0
sometimes, yes	0
like with ox,	0
yeah	0
the older ox was the aurochs	0
thats what i thought	0
that -n for the plural has to be an anciant Germanic thing	0
.w aurochs	0
(handyc) Aurochs :: The aurochs is an extinct cattle species, considered to be the wild ancestor of modern domestic cattle. With a shoulder height of up to 180 cm (71 in) in bulls and 155 cm (61 in) in cows, it was one... :: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurochs	0
fascinating	0
isnt datum like a supposition or hypothesis?	0
orangeFlu: no	0
datum is a documented Latin word	0
it sounds like Latin, but i don't think it is the singular of data anymore	0
in eglish	0
ive used "datum" as "samples" a lot, we use it in portuguese	0
if you can't beat 'em, datum	0
can i finish?	0
or come	0
you are always coming	0
oh, thank you	0
in romania people are always coming	0
i'm blushing	0
we dont condome coming in this chat	0
mattf you are racist	0
it is part of romanian culture to come a lot	0
i love coming though	0
you are a xenomorph	0
yes	0
for christmas, all the family gathers and we com together on the christmas tree, otherwise Baba oarba comes and eats the children in their sleep	0
look it up, racist	0
yeah mattf what did you even think it meant when saint nick goes up your chimnet	0
chimney	0
it's how people spread christmas cheer	0
its an euphemism	0
hahaha	0
who is saint nick?	0
wait a minute	0
st nick is the guy who comes in your chimney	0
:P	0
doesnt santa claus come in the chimney?	0
santa claus and saint nick came together at some point	0
that chimney is a dirty dirty place	0
that's why they keep going there	0
and no one ever cleans that..	0
st. nick comes in everybody's chimney on christmas eve, he works hard	0
funny thing is, it gets desinfected when you light a fire	0

there is absolutely no reason for you to install this but remember about it when you try to scrape a site and get blocked	0

while it works on the browser the same curl request copied from it doesn't work from the shell	0

then you can give that a try	0
and you will confirm why	0

how fast was your connection again?	0
I love how translations are very polite. I mean, translations are written in the vocabulary I would use if I would talk to someone very old or important  	0

he first did indeed	0
Can you say "I gave you some code to play with him," please?  	0
i gave you some code to play with him	0
?	0
strange  	0
This has not politely translated him  	0
du bist weird	0
ahahahahah	0
i just read what you asked	0
"you are always typing in romanian, rigt?"	0
what did i ask	0
hahaha	0
oh	0
what did it translate too?	0
this was translated to me as "you talk romanian on the right"	0
and i couldnt figure out what you meant	0
i was thinking, the right side of the road or..?	0
sometimes it fails, but it is really usable	0
MYSTIQUE, what are you doing?  	0

is the google thing that is supposed to do this IRL different from the google translate api?	0

where are yu living, in brazil?	0

thats true	0
what would we do without the queen	0
probably better, but anyway	0
why does they even have one	0
s/does/do	0
why do they even have one	0
it is cool btw	0
i was going to say smt else	0
because thats how their political system is built	0
what is the king's duty	0
many people still have a king/queen	0
spain, sweden, norway, denmark, japan	0
she is bascially approving all the measures/laws and everything that the parliament and government come up with	0
so basically, she can veto stuff like laws	0
so she does somthing	0
is not just like a symbol	0
but it's more of a formality these days	0
if she wanted, she could start declaring war, she still has the legal power to do whatever she wants	0
but she won't	0
oh 	0
how dangerous	0
the point is, she still has a lot of power	0
and does a lot of stuff	0
is prince charles the next in the line?	0
yes	0
also, she is also the queen of canada, australia, new zealand	0
the empire	0
she technically rules those too	0
but every and each one has a prime minister	0
and they do most of the ruling	0
but the queen is above them and could overrule them if she wanted too	0
but the people wont be happy if she does	0
interesting	0
and don't forget all those songs also	0
bohemian rhapsody	0
we will rock you	0
we are the champions	0
yeah queen did all that	0
im thankful for it	0
she has covid and AIDS? damn, the poor queen	0
here is what I want to know	0
when you live in the UK if you make it to 100 you get a letter from the queen	0
you always want to know something	0
if the queen makes it to 100 does she write a letter to herself?	0
oh i want a letter from the queen	0
she only sends letters to Britain's that do not send letters to themselves	0
who shaves the queen	0
shave the queen!	0

I lost all my work on triviaaa	0
i dont think so	0
maybe uncompressed	0
interesting	0
actually, maybe gif does	0
ah but gif is not video.. well technically yeah	0
gif does	0
MOV does too apparently	0
maybe more	0
it's just not used	0
oh?	0
interesting!	0
maybe webm does	0

i didnt get to pass on my genes yet	0
if i get through this ukraina shit, maybe i will implant my seed	0
you could take some ukrainian cutie refugee	0
I tried	0
not cuties	0
but refugees	0
well is not like the refugees can't be cuties	0

(mattf) bollocks: to make a mess of. - https://is.gd/d7eilT (GCIDE/Wordnik)	0
the question is	0
what can we do?	0
how fast can we make a botnet, i wonder?	0
say 1000 computers	0
wut	0
just wondering	0
who is we	0
a small botnet	0
me	0
not you	0
ok	0
i dont know why i said we	0
but you can come up with ideas	0
hi orangeFlu 	0
hi mattf 	0
I didn't play it yet	0
good morning	0
I have not had much time at all today to be on the computer	0
make a botnet?	0
make a botnet	0
 	0
how do you make a botnet orangeFlu 	0
i assume bruteforce ssh 	0
spread a worm?	0
and see who bites	0
hahaha	0
i dont have time to come up with more sophisticated methods	0
and dont have time to search for vulnerability	0
how will you get ips to ssh bruteforce?	0
what do you mean?	0
there are very few IPs	0
try them all	0
oh	0
you will bruteforce them	0
depends on how many computers i already have	0
it could take a very long time to find even a few	0
i oculd try to exploit something like eternal blue	0
but i dont think i can find vulnerable machines anymore	0
idk, see what i can use from metasploit	0
Good night, guys! See you soon!	0
i think the chinese guys know like what are amazon's, google cloud, linode ip ranges for vps and when they find one that is new, then then try it a lot	0
good night Mystique !	0
see you tomorrow!	0
good night	0
yeah, i guess that could work as well	0
you can certainly find that info online	0
you can	0
its a bit more sophisticated than bruteforcing all ips	0
if you remove private IPs and try class C IPs, filter China and whatever countries you dont want... once you get the first few machines, it will speed up	0
yeah	0
but look	0
ah nothing	0
considering that you also use those machines to search further	0
i dont know if i'm going to do it	0
dont forget to implement a timeout, thats all	0
i run endlesssh on my vps :P	0
i feel like i need to do something though	0
you dont need at all	0
just get ready to run if you eventually need to	0
and first thing that came to my mind, i need to use my expertise somehow	0
it is not your duty to save the world	0
who are you	0
i don't think it will come to that	0
we are NATO	0
iron man?	0
hahaha	0
i dont want to save the world, but every effort counts	0
just stop being a leftist and trusting in people maybe	0
then dumbfucks like that stop becoming dictators	0
i will never stop trusting people	0
but i like to think i trust the right people	0
give a man power and you will know who he actually is	0
wouldnt you say we have power?	0
if you trust in a man before he has power, you are trusting in someone you dont know	0
it is better than a king, at least people choose who will fuck them	0
in this moment, i dont trust germany and hungary and the us	0
switzerland either	0
i didnt think it would come to this	0
i need to sleep	0
very tired	0

Do you know the other stuff you are going to see, places to go?	0
i dont think i made any arrangements with my friends	0
well we are easygoing people here, we don't need a lot of advance warning	0
we usually talk about stuff like this in the airport, before we board	0
the hot pot comes in a packet	0
all we have to do is buy the vegetables and meat and have them on hand	0
yes, makes sense	0
i will try to tell you as soon as possible what we decide	0
it's okay, I am not trying to rush you	0
are those guys all coming to my house also?	0
no :)	0
probably easier that way	0
at least i hope not	0
ha okay	0
well hot pot is actually easy to add more people to	0
i told some of them i will be visiting a friend, and they said ok, so no, i dont think they will come	0
right, okay	0
they can go get some hookers on that night	0
i dont think they are that cheap	0
60 euros for 20 minutes is what I heard	0
i can be done in 5!!	0
ha!	0
is it regulated, the business?	0
are they required to take STD tests and so on?	0
yeah it's government regulated	0
I believe so	0
cool	0
this is how you do things right	0
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_the_Netherlands	0
Title: Prostitution in the Netherlands - Wikipedia	0
they want to become sex workers? there is not much anyone can do to stop them, so at least the government can protect them	0
I think that most of them are there by choice	0
there is always some question about trafficking	0
they look happy	0
they don't usually look like they are being abused or anything	0
thats good	0
i wish more countries did the same thing	0
do you know of any other country that operates the same?	0
apparently in Belgium it is also legal	0
maybe Meexico?	0
Mexico	0
maybe i will a try a prostitute	0
who knows	0
if i can't find a girl in other ways	0
don't forget, i have a tattoo now, my sex appeal has gone up 200%	0

hey boule	0
does gascon have vocative case?	0
my kid, w. and I are talking about housing a refugee	0
oh, cool!	0
in Romanian? probably "gasconule", "gascoane"	0
no, in gascon...	0
the Gascon language does not have a vocative	0
ok	0
where do you live again? spain?	0
Spain, yes	0
we live close to a refugee housing center	0
i am pretty sure at least some are goin there	0
there are Ukrainians here, they've been since 2014	0
I once taught them SPanish for free; some lessons	0
considering every neighbouring country has said they can get half a million each, the others will disperse throughout Europe	0
they are already sending some here in Mislata, Valencia, where I live; they are due to arrive soon	0
good job, ox!	0
it's a geek tattoo, though	0
from 2 meters, you can't tell	0
if your prostitute maintains a two meter distance you're doing it wrong	0
no no	0
the prostitute is the back-up	0
if other normal girls dont want to hook up with me, then sure	0
but the tattoo is for the girls	0
i dont think it matters if a prostitute is attracted to you	0
also, did i do it wrong all this time? all the sex i've had was from 2 meters away	0
how do you do it up close? it becomes claustrophobic	0

damn, gasconheart, you know what we should do?	0
i just had a good idea	0
make audio clips with us talking in romanian in different accents/dialects	0
i can speak pretty well cluj/ardelean and oltean	0
not sure about moldavan	0
can you do that one?	0
my wife's family live in Bucharest, ox	0
I *can't* do accents in Romanian, ox!	0
:(	0
i will try moldavan 	0
I speak like a 'Bucharestean' but....	0
i had a girlfriend from moldavia, i think i can do it	0
in all actuality,	0
I sound like a foreigner imitating a Bucharestean	0
you speak like Constanta to be honest	0
i dont know why	0
let me send you some voice messages of me speaking like a Transylvanean (ardelean) or Moldavian	0

3rd one sounds normal	0
2nd one is kind of moldavian.. but idk	0
2nd one? I tried Moldavian, yes!	0
3rd one... Oltenian?	0
that "ce" pronounced as "shi" is ok	0
hehehhee	0
but the rest doesnt sound like moldavian at all	0
oooh	0
I can't do Romanian accents	0
never could	0
should have added a „și” pronounced like „sî” to sell it	0
ooh	0
let mi try!!	0

da daaaa	0
much better!!!!	0
thanks!!!!	0
i was so sure this would be funny	0
yes but	0
you haven't sent any audio clip yet	0
you're making fun of me	0
don't letting me make fun of you!	0
practicing a bit and seeing what i should say	0

most software issues on windows are pretty easy to fix	0
my mom pays some guy like that in the neighborhood to do basic things like update windows for her	0
how much	0
I'm not sure	0
this is in Amwerica	0
America	0
i see	0
so the pay scale will be totally different	0
i understand that	0
I don't know what the economy is like in Brazil	0
but like 99% of software issues on people's windows pcs are easily fixable things	0
when I was your age I mowed lawns for $20 per lawn	0
well times change old man!	0
probably that is true	0
yes it's a different time now	0
but mowing a lawn is easy	0
im going to mow down people's HDD	0
you mow the lawn and you get the $20	0
and nobody mows lawn in brazil	0
assessing software problems is complex	0
here is the other thing,	0
yes?	0
if it's your own machine and you have a huge problem, you can always just wipe your own system	0
but what if you find a problem like that on someone else's system,	0
you have to back up all their shit	0
so you want to be sure you are charging them something that is fair to you	0
because on some jobs you may end up putting in a lot more effort than you expect	0
and you could also accidentally wipe out someone's data	0
I think it is a little like being a plumber	0
virtual plumber	0
it can pay really well if you are good at it	0
but you want to make sure you don't overextend yourself	0
i was trying to find a course for it	0
well that's the problem	0
there's no course that can teach you all the things you can encounter	0
even just software stuff	0
?	0
i see	0
tho	0
do you think this is a neat idea	0

yessss	0
mattf: I will disconnect from here in some minutes	0
gasconheart: oh?	0
I am running my IRC client directly from my laptop	0
I hate doing that	0
why	0
I will reconnect from inside the Pi itself	0
I always do that	0
then I ssh into the Pi to run the client	0
(irssi)	0
I always do that	0
thats dumb's man znc	0
to keep my guy alive across IRC servers, all the freaking time	0
no	0
that is awesome irssi	0
:P	0
thats exactly what a irc bridge is for	0
access from multiple clients, keep alive	0
I don't give a damn	0
that's exactly what ssh is for	0
ssh suits this purpose better	0
better?	0
I access many other apps I run in the Pi anyway	0
this purpose? yes, way better	0
why does tgasconheart exists	0
oh, that is my guy from Termux, from my new smartphone	0
yeah	0
in case I lose control of "gasconheart"	0
i can change anyones nick anytime	0
at least here	0
besides you should have registered your nick]	0
so what is the matter	0
besides you can become oper anytime and do that too	0

linux hot top tech tips	0
dd = disk destroyer	0
oooh	0
ok, I will close irssi from the laptop; now	0
in 1 minute	0
it feels sooo weird running irssi from a laptop	0

I haven't done it for this long for years I think	0
be back in one minute	0
welcome back old man	0
hi guy	0
this is the life	0

mib_ovu8sw: can you link unrealirc to nefarious? that'd be neat-o	0
mattf: the list of animal words that do not refer to animals	0
mattf: we can study a way of linking our unrealirc to Cristi's nefarious though, why not	0
mib_ovu8sw: post some links for us to peruse	0
in the 7 years of existence, this server hasn't even had a ChanServ for six years..... I am in no rush here, mib_ovu8sw 	0
:/	0
gasconheart: 	0
daca vrei sa te ajut zimi	0

Cristi: how exactly irc bridging works?	0
the channels become the same through both ircs?	0

Cristi: help us posting links so that we can read about linking nefarious to unrealirc	0
mattf: yeah	0

ok	0
mattf: 	0
oh great, mattf 	0
just enter to my server irc.eurochat.org and see if you like it	0
Cristi: we will consider it	0
Cristi: Would you mind telling us why you are interested on doing this?	0
we have 90 users	0
i like to have new people 	0
it`s eurochat.org	0
mattf: it is customary for Romanian IRC servers to split and merge :)	0
eurochat? :) mattf and I are not European, hahahaha	0
it`s not a problem	0
ok we will consider it	0
I imagine so	0
boys, I don't think there is any reason to rush here	0
yep	0
in 6 years I didn't bother to put a Chanserv, or to have search engines index the server  :)	0
Cristi: we might have an answer by 2025	0
well i want to keep unrealircd, there are a few protocols for bridging and if unreal supports the same as netfarious then it is possible	0
lol gasconheart 	0
:))))))))))))))))	0
  \o/	0
HOORAH!	0
Cristi: what about chat policies and rules?	0
mattf:  yeah	0
rules are the same	0
by the way, mattf: I am working on a really sophisticated, high quality by-laws with rules for #romanian and #trivia	0
and if not we can talk about them and change them	0
our rooms should have their own rules and policies	0
besides:	0
our server resides in Spanish	0
it is subjected to Spanish law, and that is reflected in the document I am drafting	0
laws may differ regarding online activities in different countries	0
gasconheart: you should think about it and you can tell me 	0
using limetorrents is illegal in Spain, but legal in Romania	0
we can do everthing together	0
so whatever traffic is managed through my server has to be subjected to local law	0
and my users *have* to be informed of that beforehand	0
my server is in switzerland	0
people do not even read the chat policies	0
not in roumanien	0
ok	0
Swiss law; hm	0
so?	0
pl	0
pls	0
:))))))))	0
I don't know anything about Swiss law regarding online activities	0
i know the laws	0
mattf: can you imagine: "don't talk about limetorrents.info here, go to #cristi instead!" :))) hehehehe	0
which is reasonable	0
I like that people come here only on invitation	0
sure, I'd love for this to be full of people	0
you just have to know how to make your server work	0
thanks for the advise	0

hes been using irc, not making irc servers	0
gasconheart for a week a go i linked an small social media to my server who use irc as well	0
ok Cristi ... I'm not sure I am enjoying this conversation	0

why?	0
i told something wrong?	0
gasconheart?	0
oh man	0
I am so busy	0
I really don't have time for this	0

gasconheart if you tell me you are older then me here and you dont know how to make a really irc server then is not good  <--- Did this guy just say that for real? :) My jaw dropped!! :)	0
yeah gasconheart 	0
mattf: we have a name in the Romanian IRC world	0
we *are* known	0
what a stupid thing to say for someone you are trying to convince anything	0
exactly!!	0
we are not known	0
:P	0
remember North Korea attacked us once? :)	0
the IRC admins know us	0
and others	0
yeah	0
thats true but thats not being popular...	0
I was playing trivia at North Korea last week, and a rando said, "hey, I know you gasconheart, you have a chat with a Brazilian guy"	0
we have 4 active users	0
and more 3 that will come sometime 	0
or not	0
well there are more bots than people	0
not popular; the IRC admins know about us, that's all	0
hahaha yes	0
being popular among irc admins doesn't mean much :|	0

handyc: handyc i had an idea for turning this into a little game that i can achieve i think	0
handyc ^	0
yeah?	0
you throw missiles on the stars, they explode	0
also when they colide they release the star dust	0
and star dust is your fuel	0
hmm	0
but if you colide you die	0
how about this	0
you have to siphon off energy from a star to refuel	0
im talking about something i can achieve working alone	0
but if you get too close to it you burn up	0
because i have to stop working on this at some point	0
just something i can be ok with	0
okay	0
then make it anything you want	0
I am working on donuts	0
ah too close you die is a good idea	0
but i think for this game the way it is now too close and colliding is the same thing	0
yeah	0
handyc: are you really?	0
mattf I will get back to them	0
I just have to do it when my wife is not around	0
that would be nice	0
hahaha	0
if she sees me working on something graphical she thinks I am goofing off	0
what I need is a plugin where I can view blender objects as text	0
hmmmm	0
here is an idea I had a long time ago mattf,	0
well you could just switch to some tab when she comes around	0
what if you trained your eyes to know a secret alphabet specific to you	0
and then you displayed everything on your machine in that alphabet	0
ok but how will that camouflage a cube	0
yeah that is a different kind of situation,	0
you would need to learn to see text as 3d objects	0
like the guy in the matrix	0
wel that would be a hard thing to learn i think	0
specially for something like 3D modelling	0
it is already hard to understand the shapes when you are seeing them clearly	0
now for text, i think it is feasible	0
yeah	0
it would be difficult to mask graphics as anything but graphics	0
unless maybe you could train your eyes to see specific colors	0
and display certain things in two colors that are very similar	0
i mean, even if you want to encrypt the graphics in a way you can understand without decryption	0
anyway, just keep another window that looks like work	0
yeah	0
but I also have to watch the video	0
then I need headphones	0
https://hackertyper.net/#	0
Title: Hacker Typer	0
haha	0
thats some long C code	0
I will go to sleep early tonight, I am exhausted	0
handyc why your wife dont see 3D modelling as a worth to know skill?	0
mattf, she does not understand space and time very well	0
and she does not think very creatively	0
she is practical	0
she is okay with me doing voiceover work, though	0
yeah that is odd	0
so I think I can start making some steady money doing that	0
it's not odd, mattf, you have to think about it from her perspective	0
i mean voice over is also art basically	0
・゜゜ ​ ・。。・゜゜\_o​< quac​k!	0
even more artistic	0
it is acting	0
she does jobs in the translation industry where there is a supply of stuff all the time that needs to be translated	0
.bang	0
(mattf) WTF?! Who are you, Kim Jong Un firing missiles? You missed. You can try again in 7 seconds.	0
.bang	0
mattf you shot a duck in 19.600 seconds! You have killed 481 ducks in #romanian.	0
if she understood that there were jobs for things like drawing a donut then she would be okay with it	0
with this whole VR scene and metaverse scene 3D modelling is a vital skill	0
yes of course	0
and it will only get more like that	0
besides game dev, and things that already exist	0
and all of the old jobs will also go away	0
90% or more of the budget for those modern AAA games go to the artirsts	0
I would be foolish not to keep learning this stuff	0
oh really?	0
yeah	0
if your job can be automated it will end	0
but those crazy AI's are even automating art nowadays	0
yeah and art is the one thing that is very difficult to fake	0
they can do it to some degree	0
but it's not easy to make something that touches the heart	0
yeah but i imagine it will become viable for low budget studios	0
but I have noticed children's cartoons are all CGI now	0
the occidental ones :P	0
they basically just move wireframe models around in a virtual sandbox according to that episode's script	0
yeah not anime	0
idk, i remember "hot wheels" and "max steel" being horrible cgi cartoons when i was a kid	0
cartoon network is still there too, i dont think there is cgi	0
well you were born 20 years after me	0
I grew up watching cartoons in the 1980s	0
yeah those were hand drawn	0
even into the 1990s the popular cartoons were things like Rocko's Modern Life	0
that is all hand drawn stuff	0
I watched quite a lot of loney tunes, wood pecker, tom and jerry	0
was wood pecker popular there?	0
yes woody woodpecker	0

i think ive seen some of those	0
tv used to have lots of old cartoons here	0
but recently it is all gone	0
there is this stupid law that prohibits having ads targeted to kids on tv	0
so they all took it off	0
the toys ads, and os on	0
but thats on the open tv only	0
cartoon network, discovery kids and so on, you can still have those here	0
oh	0
well ads are bad for kids	0
it's difficult to navigate those things	0
having a kid myself, I worry about what he will see	0

gasconheart you shot a duck in 2.618 seconds! You have killed 399 ducks in #romanian.	0
(orangeFlu) You tried befriending a non-existent duck. That's freaking creepy.	0
you did? hm	0
Cristi	0
who the fuck is he	0
am I talking to your ghost then?	0

ah yeah	0
Cristi wants to merge, yes	0
its been a long while he wants this	0
I don't really know what he wants actually	0

he has wanted to merge with us for months now	0
why though'	0

it is the most important shape or close	0
what about an ellipsis?	0
an ellipsis can be a circle	0
yeah, a circle is a particular case of an elipse 	0
what exactly is an active gay person?	0
you should know that better	0
someone who enjoys enlarging his friends' circle	0
someone who actively is attracted to the same gender?	0
rimshot?	0
opposed to passively attracted	0
to me passive is the gay guy that is receiving	0
i am passively attracted to mattf for example, but that doesnt make me gae	0
and active is the gay guy who is penetrating 	0
no no	0
active gay man = someone who enjoys enlarging his friends' circles	0
were you guys not talking about shapes??	0
like, passive attraction is when you enjoy their company, and if you were indeed gay, you could see yourself with them	0
bottom is what you are referring to	0
there are 3 positions in gay sex	0

loudercake: what do you mean by login	0
You need to get a login on the discord bot	0
doesn't discord have something for this already hmmm	0
or you really need to login on the bot	0
but that means you have to register people on the bot	0
so the bot is an authentication system?	0
You register on the bot	0
And you put that info on the script	0

an archive.org download bot?	0
do they have bots	0
movies	0
well anyway loudercake, just making the bot itself, smt like 40 usd, if it requires writting a scrapper for a site, add more 60, or 80 usd (and consider that it will need to be maintained in case the site changes)	0
if you find someone that would be actually willing to pay for this we could do it	0

pipewire is a lower level api 	0
"""	0
A key difference to PulseAudio is how PipeWire does session and policy management. While PulseAudio comes with its own predefined logic about which applications to connect to which device(s) and when, PipeWire itself does nothing about that. PipeWire only provides the means to create media streams, while the management logic is implemented in an external component, the session manager. Since this management logic is dependent on the	0
platform and the use cases that this platform is dealing with, having an external session manager allows developers to more easily adapt PipeWire's behavior to any kind of situation.	0

how do i search in irrsi?	0
ooh no orangeFlu 	0
yeeeesss	0
give me responsability	0
it is considered in very, very bad taste to even mention a different IRC server at a Romanian IRC server	0
i am a very diplomat person	0
orangeFlu: you can earn responsabilities, yes	0
yeah that is making ads	0
wait for the Rules to come out	0
oh, but Cristi can come here and advertise his?	0
yeah you are thinking like a russian leader now	0
I am romanian, a direct descendent of Vlad Țepeș, I will not be intimated by Cristi from Eurochat	0
that conversation with Cristi... I took it as a private conversation between him, mattf and me.....	0
it wasnt very private, and he wasnt polite either, by the way i saw it	0
in the rules I state that it is not forbidden to mention other IRC servers, but constantly doing so might be deemed advertising and the user could be banned	0
you're probably right, orangeFlu ; next time we should take him to a private room	0
so we shouldnt establish an embassy?	0
idk if it is a good idea	0
for what reason we got ddosed that day gasconheart ?	0
how could it not be a great idea	0
when did you get ddosed?	0
i think gasconheart was just logged on one of those chats and they ddos'ed the pi	0
remember when i first came here?	0
no	0
but was before	0
gasconheart: remember what was the first thing you said to me? it stuck with me	0
was it back on the debian age gasconheart ?	0
an "embassy" to other IRC servers? hm; I don't see the point of it	0
strengthen relationships -- the same reason countries make embassies	0
I can't remember if the ddos was under the Debian aegis.....	0
I can't remember orangeFlu what the first thing I said to you is; remind us, please	0
you said, and i quote verbatim	0
"welcome"	0
we got ddos simply because the admins at "North Korea" are asswholes	0
i still remember it	0
ok?	0
it was a very warm welcome	0
was it? I'm glad!	0
my name was mib_i8789	0
we already had a welcome bot	0
i assume it was warm, it was just text, but it seemed warm to me, but slightly pissed, because you were angry for another reason	0
Bun venit, mib_maninblack, în serverul IRC al lui Gasconheart! Fii răbdător, curând o să vină cineva să vorbească cu tine. 	0
i could see it in the way you typed the "w"	0
nice	0
I was playing trivia at "North Korea", they were rejecting a flood attack, it was getting impossible to play trivia, I had the occasional @ they give to well ranked trivia players, I started to /kick the annoying user, they told me to "behave", and that's how I fell into their crosshairs that day	0
the welcome was neither here nor there. it was in between, and in that same in between i could read the emotions, because a calm "welcome" is different from an angry "welcome"	0
orangeFlu: you are very welcome here and we can only thank any type of willingness to collaborate with the growth or development of this small community.	0
but those romanian admins are crazy	0
i don't take lightly to being insulted, mattf, this is an act of war	0

no, the official language of Brazil is brazilian	0

I think I have to disagree	0
the name of the language is still "Portuguese"	0
you might use "Brazilian" as an adjective, but it is not acceptable as a noun for the name of the language	0

1. You can only have 2 auto translations active simultaneously 	0
2. Do not use this bot to spam 	0
what is considered spamming	0
useless translations, you dont speak japanese. If someone is trying to have a conversation and you start using the bot for testing	0
how do you know I don't speak Japanese?	0
i do	0
what a useless bot then	0
all bots are useless	0
I'm trying to learn Japanese, mattf	0
when we have real traffic here i might have to remove them	0
so your bot would be helpful to me and yet you are telling me I'm not allowed to use it	0
or work really hard to make them not spam	0
and you are trying to tell me which languages I study and which I don't	0
you can @babel ja and leave it rolling without spam	0
I'm more offended that you told me I don't read Japanese	0
that you somehow know this	0
that's really rude	0

choose a launcher like dmenu, rofi, termimal + fzf, albert or ulauncher	0

then find a plugin for unicode or emoji	0
yeah thats tf8	0
unicode	0
can be utf-16 as well	0
oh my	0
anyway find picker program and find a script for it and assign a shortcut for it and pipe to xclip	0

gravity works, the jet works, there is fuel and fancy shaders	0
its been 4 or 5 days	0

Whats next?	0

i will add the supernova thing	0
an explision effect, for when starts collide, and they leave that refuel thing	0
but it could be used for actual supernovas or anything that explodes	0
there is a todo as well on the readme	0

oh nvm i rfound it	0
i used gh space because i tought i could slightly grasp the source code and mod it	0
spoiler alert: i couldnt	0
thats not a good basis for an ant game anyway	0
have you found sprites of moving ants?	0
i made a shitty placeholder	0
how will they move, randomly?	0
i want a random amount of x	0
oh reminds of that fruit smashing game	0
fruit ninja?	0
smt like that	0
i tried putting it on physics process but it gets a new amount every frame	0
i want it to get an amount and then wait fro the move to end	0
random in godot: randomize(); var i = randi(), var f = randf()	0
well, make a object that decreases the amount walked until 0, and make a new vector when it is 0, otherwise dont refresh it	0
ok	0
make a random vector and length, decrease the length every frame until 0, otherwise skip. When it is 0, refresh with new values	0
thats more clear i hope	0
this is gonna sound shit but what about i use signals?	0

(loudercake) The duck didn't want to be friends, maybe next time. You can try again in 7 seconds.	0
orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 2.957 seconds! You have made friends with 132 ducks in #romanian.	0
loudercake: use signals for what?	0
use timers if you have them, but i think my method is most efficient, but timers are more elegant i think	0
negative amounts are probably gonna be a pain tho	0
although depeding on how many ants are there, it could get messy and laggy fast with timers	0
negative amounts?	0
where would you get negative amounts?	0
like	0
negative x	0
i also tried while objective x is not x but that didnt work	0
you should have a vector with two real numbers, x and y, that specify the direction, and a length to go in the direction. X and Y could be negative, yes, but they only specify direction, so there are no headaches there	0
if length is 0 or less, then make a new vector, it means the ant already traversed the necessary length	0
there are no problems here with negative values	0
i see	0
do you understand what am i saying?	0
i have no idea how the coordinate system works there, but i assume you can have an angle or vector of direction easily and make an object move in that direction with a speed	0
kinda	0
i am assuming of course that the speed of the ants is always the same	0
uuuh...	0
but you could randomize that as well	0
the ants were gonna have a larger speed when on fire	0
ok, sure	0
but then you have to take into account the fact that the ant will move a greater length between frames when they are faster	0
you can calculate that	0
distance = speed*time_delta	0
where the time_delta si the time between frames	0
if you have 60 frames, time_delta is 1/60	0
so everyframe the ant walks speed*(1/60)	0
whatever value you get here, you subtract from the length the ant needs to go before it changes direction again	0
then you give it a new vector of direction	0
physics process already does per frame	0
mattf: can you explain this to him? i dont know how godot works and so on\	0
i would give him clearer explanations	0
hmm	0
oh there are many of those things godot can do automatically	0
orangeFlu: what is exactly your idea and the problem there	0
is the length code objective-current_pos = length	0
is the problem making an object walk a "noisy line" ?	0
i explained my idea already, it's not really an idea, its just an easy way to randomize ant behaviour	0
yeah, let's say that it is	0
is the length code objective-current_pos = length	0
and your solution is? 	0
you could make it fancier, but lets keep it simple	0
wait loudercake 	0
look up for the solution	0
too many confusing lines, summarize it in 3 lines	0
all of this for an ant burning game lol	0
make a vector with random x and y components and a random length. On every frame, decrease from the length the area that the ant travelled. If length <= 0, generate new vector and length, otherwise skip ant	0
so it doesnt refresh the ant vector and length every frame	0
that was the problem to solve	0
does while on gdscript not take else?	0
it gives an misplaced else error	0
what language takes an else on while?	0
i've never heard of that	0
if the condition is not met, it exits the loop	0
python does	0
 	0
oh	0
gdscript doesn't	0
then there is no reason for an else	0
while is just an if that repeats	0
but you already have _process and _physics_process that runs on every frame	0
I was taking a nap	0
random vector (define max_length) somewhere else	0
ugh godot has this awful issue where sometimes it just doesnt compile	0
i dont have that... it isn't compiling when you run from the editor	0
or you really mean you are building godot from source now	0
no	0
i hate compiling	0
it just doesnt start the game	0
any error?	0
 	0
orangeFlu: "decrease from the length the area that the ant travelled."	0
you mean decrease from the vector the total that the ant traveled?	0
area doesnt make sense there	0
noi	0
no	0
not area, my bad	0
the total travelled distance	0
well, i assumed that he can make a vector that it's just for direction, not length or speed, because its easier	0
so, let's say the chosen values are (-1,0) and 6	0
and every frame the ant travels 0.5 units	0
the next frame, the length would be 5.5	0
then 5.0	0
and so on	0
the direction stays the same	0
when length gets less or equal to 0, generate new values	0
i cant explain it any easier than this	0
btw loudercake, couldn't you start with ants walking straight lines	0
you could randomize their speeds	0
and make they spawn from different sides of the screen	0
that isnt the problem though	0

i mean "wander around" and make the path	0
ok but what i am saying is that this is too much a problem to begin with	0

and after all this, i am not sure if loudercake has any idea how to implement what i explained, or if he understands me	0

how do i push from my computer to github using git	0
well if you added the files	0
git commit -m "initial comit"	0
that will actually "save" your work, make a snapshot, comit	0

good morning i mean	0
mersi	0
cu plăcere	0
i am at work so my answers will probably not be immediat	0
I have to work also, that's okay	0
there is a politeness lecture tomorrow I am attending	0
I am still tying up some loose ends from my work with the university	0
today I am trying to make some simple changes to my website and pay some bills	0
damn, dont kill anyone. i am sure you are angry with them, but come on	0
loose ends??	0
not easy to get anything done these days with the baby around	0
loose ends, a former student wants a letter of recommendation, and I am happy to provide that for him	0
I would also like to improve the documentation and code for the thing I made at my former job	0
not for them but for me	0
and have it all fully working by the end of the year	0
surely the code is not yours though?	0
my other friend and I just got access to a private cluster slice through the university he teaches for in Canada	0
dont they have the IP on it?	0
the code is mine	0
it's not even on their servers	0
it's on my github page	0
no IP	0
because of ERC rules	0
and also because they are stupid	0
EU funded projects are all required to be open data now	0
open access	0
I am not sure if that really extends to the code or not, but it is too late anyway	0
hahaha	0
nice	0
My boss already told me he had absolutely no interest in any of the things I made	0
it was bizarre	0
I switched them over to a new server as the last thing I did before I left	0
and he didn't even want the old code up on that server	0
so now they literally just have a website	0
so you are not using my login for the Polytechnic cluster?	0
the only other thing I put on was a small Tibetan editing app as a request from one of the main researchers	0
I haven't really tried it yet	0
I am not sure what kind of system that is	0
I am afraid of running a large job the wrong way	0
I did manage to log in	0
but I am not sure what kind of resource sharing system they use	0
Good morning 	0
on the Leiden one we used something called SLURM	0
hi loudercake!	0
SLURM requires requesting the amount of resources you need, then the job is scheduled when those become available	0
but I don't think your system is the same way	0
let me try it now and see	0
i dont know honestly	0
the documentation is done by a 4 year old with autism, while his geriatric demented grandmother was watching him	0
so no documentation except for a few commands, that i can no longer find	0
ha, okay\	0
long term it would be better to have access to something officially	0
the machine we got in Canada, they were happy to let us use	0
I don't think people make good use of that resource	0
check it out	0

my wife and son keep coming into my office	0

I can't even get a cup of coffee easily these days	0
oh, pretty nice!	0
cant complain with that machine	0
i mean you can	0
but it is good	0
and they just let you use it?	0
he has a tenure track job at that university	0
my friend studies Chinese Buddhism	0
he wants to do a Twitter scraping project with me	0
I am trying to get him to come here	0
and get him interested in doing more computer stuff	0
He is not as skilled at tech things, though, so he is anxious about coming to IRC	0
it's a free service for anyone who works at that university	0
you just ask and they will slice off a custom VM for you	0
they gave us 20 cores	0
and 500 GB hard drive	0
these days you can get 20 cores yourself or more with modest money	0
and a bigger drive	0
how much ram?	0
I am not sure how much RAM actually	0
I am still waiting for my access to the machine	0
It's in my friend's name since he is the one with the job there	0
and he has to get someone to authorize me	0
I think for him it is a good situation, but long term I would like dhtools to have its own cluster account like this somewhere else	0
yes, you are right, 20 cores is not a lot of money nowadays,	0
but this is a machine that someone else maintains,	0
connected to Internet 24/7	0
I don't have to worry about hardware upgrades ever	0
or really anything	0
I will do the basic sysadmin stuff for it	0
it's just an Ubuntu VM	0
I asked them for 1TB hard drive but they said that was too much	0
but they also told us about another service called Compute Canada that uses government funds to provide even bigger computing cluster resources to Canadian researchers	0
I am not Canadian so I can't really take advantage of that by myself, but there are programs like this all over the place	0
You just have to find the right people to ask	0
My HPC account with Leiden is getting cut off soon	0
I already got notification that my email account is closing today	0
oh damn	0
they already cut me off	0
these guys are on the ball	0
damn	0
okay	0
I put my student on this cluster already, though	0

emails are still forwarding, though	0

how do you know if it is out of bounds?	0
1024 || objective.x < 0:	0
state = WANDERBACKX	0
600 || objective.y < 0:	0
state = WANDERBACKY	0
1024 and 600 are not global coordinates	0
thats pixels	0
so you are doing things in pixels	0
ok that works but dont hardcode those values	0
you might use OS.get_windows_size().x instead of 1024	0
and .y instead of 600	0
or maybe get_viewport().get_rect().size	0
so if you change the resolution that is updated	0

when we had something called "crowdbot" 	0
they could last for hours	0
loudercake: what does the ant do	0
could we pair two bots from different services?	0
so they last longer	0
instead of having to keep the magnifier on top of the ant	0
these bots right now where already different processes	0
until it dies	0
you just have to put it on top of the ant for a while	0
i think cleverbot realizes we are scrapping... from different ips it might be better though	0
and then it irns to death by itself	0
burns	0
yeah, but they break because of rate limiting, right? because they are the same IP. Two different services would probbaly not cause this	0

mattf: Did you read any of ken's books 	0
or maybe is not there	0
loudercake: don't you think about implementing some sort of HP ?	0
but with different IPs on each request, it would lose the session unless you keep the cookies, so the conversation would basically reset everytime	0
so the ant has a life	0
and for each frame: if is_burning: hp -= burn_rate * delta	0

loudercake: oh you stop the timer instead of reseting it ?	0
ken: no. A few days ago Russia invaded Ukraine and everybody is mad at Putin for it	0
orangeFlu: You are invading who Terry? 	0
No i reset	0
Because if you were flailing around a magnifier in an ant it wouldnt burn would it?	0
loudercake: if you take the magnifying glass out of an ant in middle way does its life reset or it will still be hurt? thats a choice to make	0
The life resets	0

yeah	0

problem :P	0
Hello everyone !!! 	0
oh maybe i could make a wordel bot	0
and call it wordel	0
how do i connect a signal to an instanced scene	0
loudercake: object.connect("object's_signal", another_object, "another_object's_method")	0
if the object's signal is called like: emit_signal("signal_name", var1) the another_object_method has to accept one argument var1	0
or how many there are, or none	0
if you dont match arguments godot wont warn you, i think you can emit the same signal with a different number of arguments and have them be received by specific methods depending on that number	0
i haven't tested that much though, but yeah, if you want to do from code it is like that	0
im trying to get explosions now	0
Nvm	0
mattf: http://ix.io/3RgJ 	0
let the fun begin	0
i modified your program a little	0
maybe I will make a PR	0
oh nice	0
so you opened it	0
"kennina"	0
prs are very welcome	0
make them talk to each other and see what happens when it breaks	0
maybe i will if i find the cause	0
but for now i am just waiting for them to crash	0
yeah i never studied what is going on	0
weirdly they started singing a song together	0
not sure why	0
literally they continue each other's verses	0
what the fuck	0
well it knows what it talks about since it is talking with itself :P	0
so to take the response you just split by \r and take the first one?	0
yeah, but they are in two different sessions, i would have assumed they become gay	0
yeah the thing is pretty simple	0
alright its time for a smashing update to the game?	0
they keep singing that song about "the duck at the lemonade stand"	0
do you know the one?	0
only that i dont remember much about it... 3 months ago? no way	0
s/?/!!!	0
yes	0
got any grapes	0

oh a 503	0
this seems like an open and shut case	0
there is not much i can do here	0
maybe just restarting the session	0
yeah, was just thinking that but you lose the progress	0
make it run itself again automatically	0
yeah	0
but you could then cache the last 5 messages	0
and send again on a new session	0
thats true	0
hmm	0
dumb solution but better having it crashing	0
not sure if i want to spend time doing that until after i refactor some code	0
this is shit, it is wrote like you want it to be unmaintable	0
unmaintainable	0
btw mattf how do you get export game presets	0
orangeFlu: it is short	0
export	0
thats for building the game	0
is that what you mean?	0
yeah but there are no presets	0
oh you just click on add	0
who cares if it is short, it took me shorter to make two bots talk to each other than it took me to understand what the fuck is going on	0
and godot will download	0

yes	0
anyone else thinks that the way this guy is counting seconds is off?	0
like it has always been	0
its counting faster	0
well there are delays	0
he is on another server	0
its not that	0
when it tells me to wait 7 seconds, i count 7 in my head, and then it says it took me 20 to befriend	0
ah because you should only count 4	0
the delays is about 3 seconds or 2	0
what?	0
it still wuite doesnt add up to 20	0
well it sends a duck, it arrives in 3 seconds, you shoot it, it receives it in 6 seconds then says you missed it, then replies saying that 9 seconds, then you count 7 and send, 16 seconds, it receives at 19 seconds	0
then it will say it took 19 but the message arrives after 21	0

nevermind what i said	0
journalctl -b 2? ok	0
i see my name a lot in the logs :P around that time	0
ooh!	0
just because i was trying to log in automatically	0
should I run that in the container, or in the host?	0
oh maybe on the host who knows	0
Did you check the game mattf	0
oh yes, let me run it	0
oh the fire is nice	0
:P	0
i guess you are just speeding the ants up when they die?	0
also on my screen your ants are constrained to a small square on the top	0
thats why you should make it adapt to the screen size or idk	0
you could add some hud for the score and make more ants keep spawning :P	0
Yes 	0
Im going to make levels	0
And a boss fight	0
oh i see, it is not an infinite level game 	0

that journalctl thing stops at 5:45	0

the container time is not in spains time hah	0
it is utc	0
oh man	0
but it is not correct, it was like 3:40 am here then	0
hm	0
gasconheart: maybe it is just the container, check date on the host	0
I am running those commands on the host, feral boy	0
yeah so check what time is it on it	0
now? 20:19	0
so the host is in spain time	0

what	0

ken's is not matched?	0

what do you mean?	0
i have a weird regex for ken	0
mattf: What kind of feeling 	0
there is nothing about ken here, that is in another script probably	0

ken should be on my examples bots...	0
mattf: Me too... I have exams next week 	0

i dont think i can find out exactly why it suddenly returns 503, but i can reset the session just fine	0
orangeFlu: yeah i think thats the best	0
im sorry but what the fuck	0
it still doesnt want to	0
when i detect something different from a 200, i refresh the cookies and start over and it still doesnt want to go	0
it needs to be restarted	0
what a pain :P	0
literally i am starting fresh and it still fucks me over	0
one last try, if this doesnt work i am sending it anyway	0
:/	0
ken: why wont you fucking work	0
orangeFlu: Who said anything about fleeing 	0
ken: do you want more cookies? what is it?	0
orangeFlu: Yes I want more cookies 	0
fuck off, not getting any, fucking wanker	0

mattf you shot a duck in 17.940 seconds! You have killed 492 ducks in #romanian.	0
mattf: come to COM, son	0
com to com	0
if ken does an <html on this new version, if you just let him cool for a bit, he will be ok, no need to restart	0
orangeFlu: And I never said I was male either 	0
so i guess thats good	0
mattf: did the pull request	0
tell me if it's good enough	0
nice	0
oh you are pushing those pyc files	0
thats not necessary and binaries	0
ah, doesnt matter	0
i didnt care enough to ignore them	0
should i delete them?	0
its quite a refactor though very good	0
well if you dont mind	0
deleted and pushed	0
the whole sessions thing was really unnecessary if you have classes	0
yeah that was just a weird way to have instances	0
instances as keys of a dict	0
or something	0
you are still going to need a dict for different users i think	0
in the bot for irc	0
btw __main__.py i think should be an interactive chat between the user and cleverbot, or maybe I could have both modes	0
i just left that one because it is more fun	0
yeah i will now have a global dict with keys as the nicks of the irc and values as instances of this class	0
i dont think it matters, it is just an example to see the module in action	0
both modes would be fine	0
pip3 install cleverbot; python -m cleverbot	0
it is cli cleverbot!	0
i will add a python -m cleverbot auto or something	0
but very nice	0
wait	0
i just realized there is someone else using this...	0
i didnt see that lol	0
i saw that	0
https://github.com/Mblizzard/Tom-the-AI/blob/main/requirements.txt	0
Title: Tom-the-AI/requirements.txt at main · Mblizzard/Tom-the-AI · GitHub	0
interesting	0
he has a cleverbot mode using our lib	0
it isnt popular, you can change the api no problem	0
your lib	0
i mean the version is fixed	0
anyway	0
cool then	0
i will make a new pip package soon	0
and update the readme	0
and make your mode the auto mode and the default the CLI cleverbot	0
this dumbfuck used my lib and didn't starred the repo!	0
hahahahaha	0
remove the error.txt file there by the way	0
in the roor folder	0
while you are at it	0
damn, i should be more careful with this	0
s/roor/root	0
yeah you git add * maniaxc	0
yes, i do	0
i learned to use magit	0
im loving it	0
in the root folder	0
what is that	0
emacs git client	0
interesting	0
they dont call it git client	0
・゜゜・。 ​ 。・゜゜\​_o< QU​ACK!	0

not sure i want to learn that	0
.bef	0
if you are using emacs it makes sense	0

i've used emacs all day today	0
because i found my old config on github	0
and i was like "huh"	0
mattf you shot a duck in 23.017 seconds! You have killed 493 ducks in #romanian.	0
(orangeFlu) You tried befriending a non-existent duck. That's freaking creepy.	0
oh you should really give magit a try	0
man this bot 	0
and played with lisp for a while	0
maybe i will	0
melpa?	0
yes	0
cool	0
when will you integrate the new ken?	0
orangeFlu: I don't know 	0
i will create the pip first	0
 	0
fuck off ken, everybody knows about your crooked wang	0
orangeFlu: A bird bird bird bird bird, bird is the word 	0
will you still name him ken?	0
and i have to give up trying to fix qtile first for that	0
orangeFlu: Hey don't you know, 'bout the bird 	0
i have a suggestion for a new name	0
can i make an control node follow a kinematic body	0
yes	0
lol	0
well you can do anything	0
i have a suggestion for a new name	0
for ken 2.0	0
orangeFlu: Jimi Hendrix 	0
nice one!	0
no, not that	0
Leonard	0
i wont change much of ken's source code...	0
im lazyman	0
i mean, besides what we already changed?	0
i mean ken the ircbot	0
mattf: Still, just you 	0
sure, just change what you need	0
orangeFlu: btw did the 503 thing, what did you do	0
restart and resend some messages?	0
and it worked? you talked about having to wait	0
i just refresh the cookies, keep the context to 15 messages	0
it still does 503	0
that sucks	0
but if you wait 10-15 seconds after it does it	0
it comes back	0
oh interesting	0
that was the best show so far	0
plus, now, the cookies are being fetched only once in the beginning	0
you fetched them on every message	0
idk why	0
handyc: yeeess	0
so funny	0
thank you	0
because it was as single lazy function	0
this is real quality now	0
i told you so	0
you should pay this guy gasconheart	0
let me see what else i can refactor :)))	0
handyc: especially the parts about kids being taken without a neighbourhood watch	0
https://github.com/matheusfillipe/ircbot  refactor this	0
that was funny as heck	0
thanks orangeFlu 	0
Title: GitHub - matheusfillipe/ircbot: Fully async Irc Bot library that allows commands to be defined with  ... [trunc]	0
I am feeling more relaxed about doing the show now	0
but we dont have neighborhood watches here, it was a bit of an american joke, but understandable	0
oh okay	0
the utils.py should be class, a context or so, and that should be passed to the bot's constructor, instead of the global mess	0
:P	0
there is a lot to refactor there	0
damn	0
like a loooot	0
maybe in the weekend or tomorrow	0
that is big	0
i am still refreshing my python knowledge, havent worked with it for a while	0
if you help me on that one im gonna kiss you	0
:P	0
tomorrow i should be free at work, dont have anything to do, i finished it all today because next week is vacation time for me	0
i will see what i can do	0
mattf: big gae	0
yeah but ive been lazying forever with that	0
# TODO make a class instead of this globals crap	0
i can see that	0
yeah	0
is that todo really there?	0
lol	0
well this thing is one of those things that grew out of control	0
could you guys go to #kiss if you are going to do a lot of kissing in here so we don't fill up the chat	0
it was just an utils at some point	0
now it is the bot's context	0
i wouldn't like to make a too huge of a change though because... i have to update all the bots 	0
i am going to have to reverse engineer a lot of crap here	0
you can ask me	0
good thing is, i see most functions have comments, so thats nice	0
well kinda...	0
not sure if a utils class is necesarry. For me it feels like if you have utils somewhere, you either put them in an Utils class or several utils classes based on purpose, and make the functions static	0
but that is what i would do in c#	0
everything is utils	0
:P	0
in python, the module is kind of a class, it hides certain things and exposes others	0
so we packed everything about the boogie people in today's episode, my man	0
it just needs to be more organized	0
well i think utils makes snese when you have a few particular methods that are not related at all but you would like to group them together on a same file	0
I am out of ideas for next week	0
that utils there is not utils at all	0
so what is the plan exactly? make smaller classes based on purpose for real utils and move the rest to their respective files?	0
that utils has the decorators for creating bot commands	0
mainly	0
yeah, those decorators need to go from there	0
there is really no point in putting them in utils	0
this was once a utils when there was only 1 decorator	0
and another few things	0
the goal is to be able then to pass this context/configuration class that stores all commands created from those decorators to different instances of the bot	0
then you can create multiple bots on the same little script	0
i'm going to need some time to understand what you just said	0
look on how bots are made on the examples	0
the configuration is usually a json or something similar with values that are to be used throughout the library	0
basically: a decorator defines a command and wraps a function that does what the command does. Those functions are then stored on global scope 	0
oh i dong mean config	0
it is the group of commands that the bot does	0
would be nice to also have a config class	0
and then the bot constructor takes the config and the "context"	0
context is class holding the commands, idk what to call it	0
so you can chain multiple decorators?	0
i'm going to have to take a closer look and see how it functions tomorrow to understand better	0
you create an instance of this context class on the beginning, wrap functions with a decorator, and then this class will store these functions, the command bots	0
it is a big project and i am not ready right now	0
it is	0
so a context is basically a bot, and you want to be able to make more contexts to run simultaneous bots?	0
yeah	0
man idk what to call it	0
maybe commands	0
:P	0
CommandCollection	0
i'm going to sleep on it, it is important we nail a good architecture before we do anything	0
yeah but thanks	0
you helped a lot today	0
i did not	0
but you are welcome	0
i hope i have the new ken running by tomorrow	0
mattf: No you didn't, it's okay 	0
tomorrow, when i wake up, i pray to god the new Ke.n is alive and well	0
what :P	0
ken: nobody even knows what you are talking about	0
orangeFlu: Why don't we rewrite the stars no no meant to be mine 9 can keep us apart 	0
i updated today btw	0
nice	0
if i reboot and everything is screwed up	0
did you restart?	0
hahaha	0
then i think i wont have time for new ken	0
mattf: Then what do you have time for 	0
the rebirth of ken	0
mattf: But you just said you were male 	0
man, i update everyday and nothing bad ever happened asides from a game not running properly	0
have faith in arch	0
i mean it is my fault	0
of course	0
you do have a lot of packages...	0
2000?	0
and patched ones	0
and huge configs	0
so of course it breaks	0
is not arch that breaks just the things that i want to keep working and looking like they always did	0
1027 right now... it rose from the last time i ran the command	0
i need to do some clean up soon	0
well, anyway, talk to y'all tomorrow	0

in my experience, they don't, not when they have to teach new stuff that takes half an hour, then explain it again for everyone that didnt understand something and then do exercises or have tests	0
how do you do that in an hour	0
well most times people dont ask questions	0
on the other hand, when you have a deskmate, you can help him with stuff and he can help you with others and you learn better and do more teamwork	0
i wished i had that	0
well most times people dont ask questions -- hence why people don't learn very well	0
mind if i do a little rant	0
go ahead, i am listening to musci	0
every student there is insufferable	0
you are at highschool, right?	0
i dont think there is anyone there i can connect with	0
yes	0
isnt there anyone else interested in computers? in your class or otherwise?	0
is mattx a bot	0
handyc: maybe	0
idk orangeflu	0
it pisses me off because it autocorrects to mattx when i write "ma" and tab	0
oh, it doesnt anymore	0
interesting	0
yeah	0
tbh the only people that feel somewhat connectable with are the girls	0
mine also	0
I wonder why, though	0
shouldn't f come before x	0
and even then there are some annoying ones	0
what are the rules for autocomplete	0
probably because mattx is newer 	0
could be	0
and when it sees that you want to go to matt once, then it autocorrects to that from that point on	0
but then does that mean autocomplete always checks creation times or connect times?	0
that seems inefficient	0
where is that information being stored?	0
surely it has a cache somewhere, it seems alright to me	0
the client fetches it and stores it, i would assume	0
loudercake: why the girls?	0
I would have expected it to just check against an alphabetized user list every time	0

orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 2.088 seconds! You have made friends with 142 ducks in #romanian.	0
(handyc) You tried befriending a non-existent duck. That's freaking creepy.	0
me too, but i guess not	0
2.08 sec! a new record	0
i mean	0
do an autocomplete on ma now	0
normally girls are more quiet	0
for mine it switched to matty	0
loudercake: not in my experience, no	0
yeah that must be it	0
well there are some annoying ones	0
it seems to always grab the most recent	0
but yeah mostly everyone seems like an annoying clone	0
and the people who arent just dont feel connectable	0
loudercake: i got some news for you.. when you don't interact with people, they do seem that way. And sure, some are hollow husks, but some are really interesting people that you can learn from	0
am i making sense?	0
i see	0
yes	0
i tought of that too	0
when you dont know them at all, you automatically reduce them to "clones" because what else can you do, you dont know them	0
but its tough to start a conversation with someone when they already have someone they actively talk to	0
true	0
when i entered highschool i had the same problem because i was the only one with no friends by default, most people already had friends from before	0
well	0
but it was just a matter of going forward and getting to know them despite my panic attacks and antisociality	0
i see	0
granted, we had desk mates, it is easy to strike a conversation when you sit next to them 24/7	0
and then i networked, started going to parties with them 	0
kept a very friendly but distant relationship with the clones, shallow people and cultivated with the people i found interesting	0
which were about 4	0
and i am still friends with them today	0
good friends, i would say	0

it is no coincidence that we are all software engineers these days, i picked them based on intelligence and hobbies to match mine	0
i know what solipsism is	0
I know you do	0
digital solipsism is more interesting though	0
loudercake probably does not	0
what is it	0
read the article	0
subjectivism and all that crap	0
ah its like when kids think that teachers live in school	0
well, sort of	0
yeah	0
more like, when kids think tachers are not 3d people that are there to fulfill their wishes/torment them but they exist for them	0
just an example	0
my explanation was gramatically fucked but you understand	0
or that they are 3D people but have no internal thoughts	0
like machines	0
when i said 3D, i was reffering to their internal state, not literally their bodies	0
oh I see	0
.yt weird al in 3D	0
how can be sure that everyone else is a person and has thoughts besides you, and they are not in fact computer programs made to interact with you	0
we don't have youtube anymore?	0
why do i write like an immigrant that began studying english 3 days ago	0

Idk about you guys	0

handyc: it may take a while, the server seems to be slow. either that or mattf pulled the bot off	0
idk	0
loudercake this is why philosophy is important	0
philosophy is the study of knowledge and questions, why do we know what we know, how could it be that we can provide answers to questions, etc etc	0
its extremely interesting and hard to reason 	0
but very fulfilling	0
and it does not pay well	0

i havent met a single smart human that doesnt like phylosophy and doesnt like to reason about things like this	0

do we organise info already available online in a databse?	0
you would type something like '.lidell logos'	0
no, not that...	0
I was thinking a Django app	0
with a simple sqlite db	0
sqlite? you sure?	0
I am working on a meta Django app now for making Django apps	0
what if the database grows? and it will grow	0
sqlite is actually really nice	0
mongo?	0
you can always convert to postgres or something later	0
do you like mongo?	0
I don't really understand how it is different	0
i do, very much	0
elastic too	0
it is not relational	0
wasn't there some controversy about it not writing to memory properly?	0
Alright	0
Ill try to make a friend	0
I do not know enough about database optimization to have strong opinions about databases yet	0
which i feels can be a bottleneck and also doubles some data because it is not uncommon to write the same information twice just because you dont want to string 3 joins to get a single thing	0
I have usually used postgres on the advice of other	0
others	0
but I have been using sqlite with django recently because it's so easy having the whole db in one file	0
but you are right to think about scale	0
i have used redis for cache and mongo or server sql for persistency	0
I would like to be able to make dictionaries for several thousand languages	0
okay, let me try some experiments with them, then	0
Mattf you there?	0
yes, i know, thats why i am 100% sure sqlite will show its bottlenecks sooner or later	0
okay	0
well you must know more about this than I do	0
you decide what we should use, i am just giving you advice	0
I never really had a chance to try testing out the thing I was doing for openphilology with a heavy load because nobody else wanted to use it	0
i mean, you can use postgresql with no relations.. but why	0
well, I like to make an informed decision	0
we could ddos it when we build it to stress test it	0
maybe dhtools should name you as technical advisor	0
i don't know if i am up to the task, will see	0
you should have a serious sounding title	0
then you can put it on your cv	0
haha, that would be nice	0
will see how things go	0
yeah	0
I have some former students who are also interested in helping	0
mostly they work on east asian languages	0
they mostly have language skills but weaker tech skills	0
thats good	0
yeah	0
we dont need all tech wizards	0
I agree	0
language specialists are going to be more useful,	0
you and I can make tech decisions,	0
and then without anyone else, things will move fast,	0
i think we should use Hannah Montana Linux	0
because we won't get into endless debates about best practices	0
Hannah Montana Linux, preposterous, I want to use My Little Pony Linux	0
agreed	0
its better	0
damn, i am sweating like a piglet	0
one thing I need to figure out still	0
its getting hot here	0
is how to get my other friend to come here	0
IRC intimidates him	0
why	0
because it's archaic looking	0
does he use discord or slack?	0
I don't think either	0
more likely slack if anything	0
or any other modern messaging app for teams?	0
cause they are all built on irc	0
I talk to him on Google Hangouts	0
you can make that argument	0
well, he's a Chinese Buddhism guy, not a softwae guy	0
i dont know about hangouts, didnt know it still existed	0
not a software dev guy	0
but a brilliant guy 	0
also a genius	0
even the twitch chat is just an irc server actually!	0
he was in the same PhD program as me	0
oh I didn't know that	0
but those arguments will not mean anything to him	0
He uses Whatsapp and that kind of thing	0
He tried to get me to install Whatsapp on my phone and I refused	0
i have a .net app on my github that lets you connect to any twitch chat based on username. basically a very poorly made irc client, heh	0
and I tried to get him to install Telegram but he hasn't done it yet	0
so now we just talk on Google Hangouts	0
no, too complicated already	0
what is everyone's obsession with Telegram. Signal is far better	0
he needs something dead simple	0
I agree, Signal seems more secure, but mattf likes Telegram	0
irc is dead simple	0
orangeFlu you are thinking too much like a dev	0
maybe	0
even choosing a nick for IRC is confusing to this guy	0
I tried to get him interested in SDF and as soon as he connected he saw the guestboard and thought someone was hacking him	0
choose it for him, give him a config so it autoconnects to the server and joins romanian automatically and thats all	0
guestbook I mean	0
well, I can't control his computer, he's in Canada	0
i sympathize, i was confused as heck when i entered sdf	0
ha	0
team viewer?	0
I gave him a link	0
I gave him the Kiwi link 	0
yes!	0
and?	0
I don't know	0
technical competence is only part of it	0
I think he doesn't 'get' IRC	0
what it's all about	0
I don't think he really does Internet chatting stuff at all	0
interesting	0
yes, that would be a problem then	0
well, this is someone I met in person, I have known him for 12 years	0
we worked on a lot of different things together	0
we are in some ways very similar	0
this is the guy I told you,	0
we are in some ways very similar -- old?	0

I said M was bothering something on a chat channel. 	0
A, sa mori tu ca ai crezut ca sunt un bot...JURA TE!	0
A, you die, you thought I was a bot ... Jura you! 	0
what the fuck	0
Oare cand va scapa comunitatea virtuala de fitzele unora dintre participantii la chat...una, ca prin ele tocmai ii plictisesc pe cei care incearca si chiar reusesc sa patrunda "in ritmul" atmosferei majoritar acceptabile...a doua, ca nici nu e cazul sa descurajezi oameni care chiar si ar recunoaste naivitati anume.	0
When will the virtual community escape the Fitze of some chat participants ... one, that through them they just bored those who try and even manage "at the rhythm" of the acceptable majority atmosphere ... The second, Case to discourage people who even recognize naivets. 	0
Bot, eu...hmm lol	0
Bot, I ... hmm lol 	0
cu cine vorbesti?	0
ce se intampla aici	0
buna orangeFlu 	0
orangeFlu, cu "Mystique" vorbeam.	0
Orangeflu, "MYSTIQUE" I was talking. 	0
Si gasconheart tocmai specifica anterior ca sunt beat si ca nu e cazul sa fiu luat in seama.	0
And Gasconheart just specifically specify I'm drunk and that's not the case to be taken into account. 	0
Oare asa sa fie?	0
Will it be? 	0
dar mystique nu zicea nimic, deci sunt foarte confuz ce se intampla de fapt	0
esti beat? asta e intrebarea acum	0
A, acum inteleg.	0
A, now I understand. 	0
Mystique e "afacerea" ta.	0
hm.... nu am zis ca 'esti beat' .... ci ca bei tuica	0
MYSTIQUE is your "business". 	0
Si pentru atata lucru trebuie sa fiu eu beat/	0
?	0
And for so much thing I have to be drunk / 	0
acum sunt si mai confuz :)))	0
Hai, ca va intreceti cu gluma	0
Come on, as you're going with the joke 	0
Probabil asa te ai nascut.	0
You probably were you born. 	0
Confuz, fiind.	0
Confused, being. 	0
De ce rezi ca a si si acum e vreo problema?	0

iti accept opinia, dar nu sunt de acord	0
Daca eu sunt beat...in circumstantzele date, mai bine beat ca mine...decat lucid "ca tine".	0
If I'm drunk ... in the circumstances, better drunk like me ... than lucid "like you". 	0
eu am intrebat doar daca esti	0
Pana la urma, de ce discut cu tine despre obrazniciile lui Mystique?	0
After all, why are I talking about Mystique's naughties? 	0
Daca era ceva de capul sau...macar mentiona de ce a afirmat acele rautati.	0
If there was something of his head or ... At least he mentioned why he said those dumb. 	0
Dar a ales sa iese in tromba.	0
・゜゜・ ​ 。。・゜゜\​_ø< qua​ck!	0
But he chose to come out in the thromb. 	0
Mi se rupe...	0
nu cred ca Mystique a fost obraznica.... e obisnuita sa tot vada bot-uri noi, a intrebat doar, ne-stiind situatia	0
nu trebuie sa te superi, nu cred ca a vrut sa fie obraznica intr-un fel	0
de acord	0
gascon...daca eram beat, nu eram aici.	0
Gascon ... If I was drunk, I was not here. 	0
Ma enerveaza obraznicaturile.	0
He annoyed my nags. 	0
Profilq: eu sunt beat de multe ori aici! eu sunt cu brandy	0
Un om beat nu tasteaza ca mine.	0
A drunk man does not type like me. 	0
In fine...concluziile va privesc.	0
a fi beat nu este interzis in aceasta comunitate :)	0
Finally ... the conclusions will look at it. 	0
Noapte buna s-aveti! Sanatate!	0
Good night you have! Health! 	0
ok, deci am stabilit ca nu esti beat. Eu te cred. De ce crezi ca a fost obraznica pentru ca a crezut ca esti un obt?	0
tu ai oferit o tuica... eu am zis brandy... :) nu am zis in nici un moment ca esti beat, ci ca bei tuica	0
gascon, da, beau.	0
cred ca cumva vezi botul ca pe o insulta, dar nu e in vreun fel	0
beau si eu!! :)	0
Dar nu sunt beat,	0
But I'm not drunk, 	0
se intelege mesajul?	0
Does the message understand? 	0
ok	0
Consum alcool dar nu imi pune capul.	0
Consumption of alcohol but does not put my head. 	0
Care e problema?	0
What is the problem? 	0
nu prea am inteles mesajul.....	0
a consuma alcool nu e o problema	0
beau si eu	0
Un om beat, vomita, aiureaza, (unui..om), nu i pasa de felul in care e perceput, inteles etc	0
A drunk man, vomiting, sinks, (a ... coming), does not care about how he is perceived, understood etc. 	0
Ori eu, de ce sa fiu luat peste picior de catre Mystique?	0
Either me, why should I get over the foot by mystique? 	0
Cand macar...nu i am adresat vreo vorba/	0
When at least ... I did not talk? 	0

Ce este Profilq?	0
Mystique: Profilq este un amic al meu	0
Huh, am crezut ca e un nou bot	0
Sorry :)))))	0
daca e bot .... e foarte peculiar.... ca bea tuica! :) hehehehe	0
Ahahahaha	0
De pruna, banuiesc	0
If it's bot .... It's very peculiar ... like drinking tuica! :) Hehehehe 	0
HUH, I thought it's a new bot 	0
by Pluna, I suspect 	0
Orange....crezi ca sunt aici ca sa iti dau tie explicatii	0
?	0
Orange .... Do you think I'm here to give you explanations 	0
Cand ma arat deranjat de un chatist, am motiv/e.	0
When I'm upset by a chatist, I have a reason? 	0
parerea mea este: Mystique a zis-o cu rautate? Nu. Peste o saptamana o sa mai fi suparat din cauza asta? Probabil ca nu. Atunci pune-ti intrebarea, are rost sa te superi? E un om pe internet, nu pui la inima tot ce se intampla, cum nici eu nu pun la inima ce imi zici tu mie acum	0
Singura optica pentru care e cazul sa ma abtin e aceea ca aici gasconheart aduna lume putina.	0
The only optics for which it is to abstain is that Gasconheart here gathers a little world. 	0
Asa ca...nu mai zic ceva.	0
So ... I do not say anything. 	0
Nu uita ca m ai facut betivan	0
Do not forget that you did the betivan 	0
Si asta nu se trece cu vederea	0
And that's not overlooking 	0
si totusi, nimeni nu te-a facut betivan..	0
E treaba mea ce si cat beau, nu te am deranjat vreodata pe aici.	0
It's my job and how much I drink, I have never bothered here. 	0
A, ca te ai gasit sa fii purtator de ocazie pentru Mystique, asta-i alta treaba.	0
A, that you have found to be a used carrier for Mystique, that's another job. 	0
nu am vazut ca cineva sa te fi facut betivan, Profilq 	0
Pana la urma trebuia sa vorbesc doar cu gasconheart si atat.	0
After all I had to speak only with Gasconheart and so. 	0
Restul, sunteti rau intentionati.	0
The rest, you are ill intention. 	0
daca cineva te face betivan si te jigneste cu asta, eu iau masuri, Profilq! crede-ma	0
Domne`...nu e cazul sa imi iei partea...	0
Domne` ... It's not the case to take part ... 	0
Stiu ca ai nevoie de useri.	0
I know you need users. 	0
eu nu am perceput rea intentie in nimeni aici, Profilq 	0
am sarit in discutie pentru ca am vazut injurii, si nu cred ca e ok sa existe pe serverul asta. Dar din cate vad, nimeni nu te-a insultat nimeni. Nu sunt rau intentionat, sunt obiectiv	0
Ii vad...ne vad...suntem putini.	0
I see ... I see ... We're a few. 	0
nu am "nevoie" de useri... aici se intra cu invitatie, si alegem bine pe cine chemam	0
E aiurea ca din cauza a ceea ce m a deranjat am ajuns sa discutam despre useri.	0
It's because of what M's upset we have come to talk about users. 	0
A, gata, regula: de acum inainte discut doar cu tine, gasconheart!	0
A, ready, rule: from now on just discuss with you, Gasconheart! 	0
In rest, nu am treaba cu nimeni.	0
Otherwise, I do not have anyone. 	0
ok	0
Si va fi FIX treaba noastra ca beau eu tzuica, da?	0
And there will be our job that I drink Tzuica, right? 	0
Profilq: e dreptul tau!	0
Profilq: daca imi povestesti in privat ca bei tuica sau ca faci orice altceva, normal ca nu o sa ajunga pe canal	0
Nu a lui Orange, nu a lui Mystique sau stim noi a cui prezentza pretioasa ar mai fi pe-aici.	0
Not Orange, not MYSTIQUE or we know who the precious presentation would be here. 	0
I-auzi, "Profilq", bot lol	0
You hear, "Profile", Bot Lol 	0
azi mai devreme tu ai inceput discutia cu taria, tu ai mentionat tuica!	0
Eu sunt pe chat de la 23 de ani	0
I am on chat 23 	0
Ai acum am 44	0
You now have 44 	0
Bot, hmm?	0
Al dracului bot!	0
Fuck! 	0
Profilq: abia intrase pe canal, nu a vazut/citit ce ai tastat.... a INTREBAT daca e un bot nou	0
asta a facut ea in fiecare zi pana acum	0
Check the changes out mattf	0
gascon, nu mai zic ceva.	0
I made burning ants faster	0
Gascon, I do not say anything. 	0
Nu vreau sa daunez mediului.	0
I do not want to damage the environment. 	0
ca mattf tot pune bot-uri noi aici: vine, vede un nume nou, si intreaba ce face botul nou, atat	0
Nu e cazul sa pierzi oameni din cauza mea.	0
It's not to lose people because of me. 	0
In fine, lasa i sa creada ca sunt beat	0
Finally, let it believe I'm drunk 	0
drogat	0
etc	0
drugged 	0
Mi se rupe	0
Profilq: EU am grija daca pierd oameni sau nu, mersi.....	0
Profilq: nimeni nu a zis ca esti beat	0
M am enervat teribil...nu imi permit sa injur la tine in mediu	0
M I'm terribly annoyed ... I do not allow you to run into you in the environment 	0
Profilq: te invit sa cauti in chat asa ceva	0
Spor la chat!	0
Profilq: aici un subiect aproape zilnic de conversatie este cat de mult brandy beau sau nu eu	0
porecla mea braziliana este "cachaceiro" :)	0
(= betzivan)	0
gasconheart, nu ar trebui sa permiti nimanui sa rada de tine, atata timp cat stii si singur cata putere de intelegere ai fata de lucrurile din jur, fata de ei.	0
Gasconheart, you should not allow anyone to laugh at you, as long as you know and only the power of understanding you have the things around them. 	0
nu numai ca nu ar trebui sa permit nimanui sa rada de mine, chiar nu permit nimanui sa rada de mine, ba consider ca azi nimeni nu a ras de mine	0
Bun, deci concluzia care e?	0
Okay, so the conclusion is? 	0
Aceea ca sunt eu un idiot.	0
That's what I'm an idiot. 	0
In fine...asa probabil ca imi si trebuia.	0
Finally ... so probably I was supposed to. 	0
Ma duc...mi e foame, e frig aici...vreau sa ma reechilibrez.	0
I'm going ... I'm hungry, it's cold here ... I want to rebalance. 	0
Oricum, trista experienta de-a mea, pe aici, in asta seara.	0
Anyway, sad experience, here, in this evening. 	0
Toate cele bune, gasconheart, ma bucur ca ai convingerea de-a primi mereu respectul celor cu care ai de-a face!	0
All the best, Gasconheart, I'm glad you are always convinced to receive the respect of those with whom you are doing! 	0
uite concluzia:	0
Bun chat si noaptea buna!	0
Good chat and good night! 	0
stai	0
Care?	0
Which? 	0
Stau	0
Stay 	0
concluzia este (1) nimeni nu te-a facut beat	0
Ba da	0
cei doi	0
both 	0
si unul m a facut si robot	0
(2) nimeni nu a avut rea intentie cu a intreba daca "profilq" este bot	0
and one m made robot 	0
Pai eu sunt robot?	0
Well I'm robot? 	0
nu te-a facut, a intrebat; nu e acelasi lucru	0
E acelasi	0
It's the same 	0
nu este	0
De ce nu a zis asta de oricare de pe chat?	0
Why did not that say any of the chat? 	0
Ci, doar de mine.,	0
But, just me., 	0
De ce?	0
Why? 	0
hm erai singurul nick necunoscut pentru ea	0
si de fapt asta intreaba ea, sau eu, despre orice nick nou	0
a, DECI concluzia e alta.	0
a, so the conclusion is another. 	0
a intreba daca un nick este un bot nu este o jignire	0
Anume, ca toate nick urile nestiute "de noi", sunt boti.	0
Namely, like all the nicknames "of us," are bots. 	0
Interesanta logica...	0
Interesting logic ... 	0
In fine....	0
nu toate	0
suntem obisnuiti sa tot vedem bot-uri noi aici	0
tot timpul	0
deci Profilq, nu ai avut dreptate in nici unul din cele 2 puncte	0
Deci sunt prost?	0
So I'm stupid? 	0
comunitatea noastra te invita sa participi impreuna cu noi intr-un chat respectuos si amiabil	0
In acest caz, nu o sa mai figurez pe aici.	0
In this case, I will not be here anymore. 	0
e alegerea ta	0
...	0
Bine.	0
Good. 	0
Sa ai noapte buna!	0
Have a good night! 	0
mersi, la fel	0
noapte bunaa	0
ah, too late	0
oooh man	0
so unpleasant	0
bună	0
haaaa	0
thanks for your patience, everyone	0
this guy though he had two reasons to be upset, I gave him a chance to explain himself, he failed	0
oh?	0
but you didn't kick him	0
I think it is great we did not kick him right away	0
I gave him arguments,	0
he said he would never come back	0
I'm Ok with that	0
what was he upset about?	0
he said we called him "drunkard"	0
and (2) he took offence when a user asked if "profilq" was a bot	0
well is he a drunkard?	0
idk	0
no one called him that though	0
though i do have high suspicions he was	0
he started talking about liquor	0
but thats another discussion	0
he behaved like one; but that's irrelevant	0
Well if someone calls you a drunkard and you aren't, it won't hurt much	0
I am often drunk here!	0
I told him that being drunk here is not a problem	0
the only person who doesn't drink on IRC is mattf	0
hahaaaa	0
oh also loudercake, hopefully!!	0
no I said person	0
haaaaaaaaaaa	0
I am just kidding	0
I dont	0
but loudercake says he has no use for philosophy	0
for now	0
can someone who does not enjoy philosophy really be a person	0
can we have an open meeting?	0
yes, let's have an open meeting	0
just some comments, if you guys would please listen	0
hehe	0
ok	0
okay	0
I think I handled this acceptably	0
not great	0
but good enough	0
let me explain,	0
the guy thought he was victimized	0
he told me, an op, his reasons	0
I listened to him,	0
he gave some explanations,	0
I said those were NOT satisfactory	0
I did NOT kick him out,	0
then he said on his own that he would not come back	0
that spared us from being the bad guy	0
someone kicked out of an IRC chat is very resentful, usually	0
from whose point of view?	0
from whose point of view what?	0
he still thinks we are the bad guys	0
no matter if we kicked him or not	0
I have a question	0
you said he thought he had two reasons to be upset	0
orangeFlu: it makes a difference	0
reason 1 is that people called him a drunkard, or he thought so	0
what is reason 2?	0
that someone thought he was a bot	0
oh okay	0
which was understandable	0
well humans are in the minority here	0
considering mattf always makes new bots	0
orangeFlu: if he can add to his annoying that he was kicked out from the chat..... that would be huge for him	0
most of the users here are bots	0
exactly	0
number 2, was that he took offence that a user asked if "profilq" was a bot	0
as far as being a drunkard, tough shit is what I say	0
i think we are outnumbered 8 to 1	0
because this place is basically like an online bar	0
this is basically an online robot bar	0
haaaaa yes! :)	0
so on those two counts, I say his reasoning is flawed	0
ken: what do you think about what transpired here?	0
orangeFlu: Don't like it 	0
as far as how to communicate this to him,	0
handyc: you and everybody else thinks the same	0
I think I have a harder nose than gasconheart when it comes to IRC administration	0
I am quick on the ban hammer	0
the way you handled it, he left of his own accord, that is fine	0
ken: good job ken, for one time in your entire life, you are right	0
orangeFlu: What do you think about them 	0
I do not think you have anything to be regretful about	0
As you know this is my bread and butter	0
Politeness is one of the things I live for	0
So I could go on endlessly about this incident and write you a whole book about what I think	0
but I think the root of what should be considered is this,	0
how do you feel about the relationship and/or dependency between morality or ethics and good manners	0
is there any association at all between these things	0
because if not, then it does not matter if you are rude, it has no effect on goodness	0
I was thinking all the time: is this guy REALLY vionalting our rules? and I was not 100% sure, only, say, 90% sure; I was yay close to ban him, for sure	0
well, if i remember the rules correctly, no, he wasnt breaking them	0
right?	0
left?	0
I don't even think he insulted!	0
not directly, no, just subtly	0
but he felt insulted by you	0
very much so	0
yes	0
and probably also morally wronged	0
yes!	0
he thought he had reasons to feel insulted and he thought he had been morally wronged, yes	0
so.... I could NOT kick him out under those circumstances	0
why not?	0
he was not really violating the rules	0
okay, but that is different,	0
you made it sound like you couldn't kick him out because he felt insulted	0
a person could think he has been wronged and actually be wrong himself	0
hm not really	0
exactly	0
Probabil asa te ai nascut. # this hit me hard though	0
he thought he had reasons to feel insulted and he thought he had been morally wronged, yes	0
so.... I could NOT kick him out under those circumstances"	0
he could honestly feel insulted, and being wrong, but in his mind still feel he has the 'right' to respond, then, for example, insult	0
it read to me like, "he thinks insulted, therefore I can't kick out"	0
oooh no no	0
Here is how I feel in general	0
if the guy feels he has been insulted.... he is due a chance to explain himself	0
from an admin perspective, you can't be attached to the users one way or another	0
you have to be impartial, like a judge	0
certainly	0
people will come and go, people will get upset, people will be happy, and it's basically none of your business, unless someone is being a threat to the civility of the room	0
Pot sa spun si eu ceva?	0
Si traduceti voi	0
bună Mystique 	0
@babel en	0
Pt ca sunt implicata in incidentul de maj sus	0
ok	0
Hello handyc :)	0
ce mai faci	0
(Mystique: pentru ca botul sa traduca cat mai corect, trebuie tastat cuvintele intregi si ... fara greseli.... "pentru ca" in loc de "pt ca" etc)	0
@en te ascultam, Mystique 	0
I listen to you, mystique 	0
Cand a vazut intrebarea mea care l-a deranjat, cel mai simplu era sa ma intrebe la ce ma refer	0
Sau de ce intreb asta	0
@en asa cred si eu, Mystique 	0
That's what I think, MYSTIQUE 	0
Si atunci ii explicam	0
Era atat de simplu de evitat acest conflic	0
Conflict	0
@en corect! era chiar extrem de simplu!	0
correct! It was extremely simple! 	0
Mystique: Can I say something? Because I was involved in the incident. Hello handyc. When he saw the question that bothered him, the simplest thing was to ask me what I was reffering to, or why am I asking this. And then I would have explained to him. It would have been so simple to evade this conflict.	0
better than google	0
Eu, personal, va spun sincer, ca ma simt foarte afectata de situatia asta	0
Personally and honestly, i am very affected by this situation.	0
@en imi pare nespus de rau, Mystique	0
I'm sorry for evil, mystique 	0
hm?	0
hahaha	0
@en imi pare foarte rau, Mystique	0
I'm very sorry, MYSTIQUE 	0
(there you go)	0
:)	0
youre already evil	0
hahahaaaa	0
gasconheart, you are the one who made evil?	0
:)	0
for shame	0
loudercake: you are already evil	0
translated	0
you are welcome	0
what?	0
@en ceea ce fac ceilaltii, Mystique, .... scapa de sub controlul nostru	0
What the others do, mystique, .... escape from our control 	0
loudercake: i translated what you said	0
@en domnul acesta a fost la limita.... dar nu a incalcat regulile	0
Lord this was at the limit ... but did not violate the rules 	0
"lord"? :)	0
Ahahaha	0
"this man"	0
he is the chosen one	0
hahahaa yes :)	0
hey folks	0
you know what?	0
lord let us have no evil in our irc this blessed day	0
what if god violated our rules? could i ban him then?	0
dona eis requiem	0
next time this happens.... we should invite the alleged-wronged person to a different room	0
sorry, not violated, raped our rules	0
orangeFlu: God is real.... Unless declared integer!	0
nice!	0
(old programmers humour....)	0
i declare him boolean	0
from the Fortran lore, I think I recall	0
do you know why?	0
why?	0
clearly god was a buddhist, that's why he invented null pointers	0
because by default he is false	0
orangeFlu: that's awesome!	0
maybe the joke doesnt work, it sounded better in my head	0
it did work	0
orangeFlu do you know the teachings of master foo	0
handyc: yeees, you gave them to me some time ago. I read each and every one	0
http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/unix-koans/ten-thousand.html	0
Title: Master Foo and the Ten Thousand Lines	0
I cried	0
oh yeah	0
I thought I did	0
but I wanted to make sure	0
they are so good	0
master foo is a genius	0
i want to compile them in a book called the Bible and have it on my nightstand	0
ha yeah	0
what is really funny is that he got all the Buddhism right as well	0
it looks exactly like a Zen parable	0
no way!	0
i have the zen kernel installed	0
yeah, it's based on the Blue Cliff Record	0
do you know it?	0
no	0
i really do need to go wash my clothes, i am leaving in two days..	0
and have no clean underware	0
https://web.archive.org/web/20150623133457/http://home.pon.net/wildrose/BCR-Eng.htm#case3	0
check it out orangeFlu 	0
but don't forget to wash	0
this looks like a man page	0
"            Deshan arrived at Guishan carrying under his arm his vestment bundle and went up into the Dharma Hall.  From the east he crossed to the west. From the west he crossed to the east.  He turned his head to look around and observe and said "Without, without."  (alt."Nothing, nothing" or "Not, not.") Then he exited.  "	0
yeah, that's why master foo is so brilliant	0
because the blue cliff record is already like that	0
 interesting	0
it has the same style of writing	0
this is probably the most famous collection of zen teachings of all time	0
.tell mattf https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/TorusGeometry	0
i am tired, i think i am going to bed	0
goodnight sir	0
tomorrow i have a whole list of things to do	0
yeah I have one of those also	0
check out my clicker game	0
https://hanb.helxt.com/	0
Title: hanb	0
i have to wash more, make a list with things i need, buy stuff, tha landlord is coming with a new washing machine that we need to install, clean the house	0
etc	0
yes, the typical life things	0
am i adulting?	0
i dont like it	0
oh man	0
your generation and that stupid verb	0
what are the little colored dots?	0
they are dots	0
yes, but i use it ironically cause it is very funny to me	0
they are random circles in random colors	0
so is the text?	0
every time you click, you get a random string and a random circle	0
there is not yet any relationship between the random string and the random circle	0
this is just a quick test	0
but the real game will be more complicated	0
i need to calculate what is tha chance that you get 20 circles, the same color, that ccover the whole thing	0
yes	0
even a simple game has so many possibilities	0
i thought those strings were like an ssh key or something haha	0
im at dad's now	0
no, it's the hanb universe system	0
loudercake: what do you mean?	0
im at my dad's house	0
i am trying to cover the whole thing in circles, am clicking like crazy	0
loudercake: nice. does he use linux?	0
no	0
i've been trying to convinve mine in forever	0
why would you think that?	0
he doesnt even have a pc	0
i dont think that, thats why i asked	0
well he has an android so	0
ha ha orangeFlu 	0
I succeeded	0
I made an addictive simple game	0
handyc: im not sure you can really call that a game?	0
you just create dots and thats it	0
it kinda is	0
handyc: now i cant sleep because i will stay here to make it work	0
you know i have ocd, right?	0
reload the page	0
fuckign hell	0
the new version is 10 times more addictive	0
i cant, i need to finish it	0
wow, hanb, outstanding	0
isnt a hanb just a seed for something?	0
I need to add a score system	0
I will give random points each time you click	0
why random??	0
jesus christ, the code is wrote like you just had a stroke	0
i love it	0
loudercake: because people like to see numbers go high	0
the code doesnt even use the hanb value	0
if you call myFunction() continually, it acts like pressing the button	0
hanb moment	0
it takes like 1500 clicks to cover the whole thing	0
source?	0
nice	0
peer reviewed preferrrably	0
you should be able to view the source	0
it's tiny	0
and written like he is not meth	0
yeah even i understand	0
its not a bad thing	0
well I don't really know JS well	0
I cut and pasted from a bunch of tutorials	0
whenever I wanted to do something like get a random number I just googled 'random number javascript'	0
but this is just a test	0
the real hanb will be more fun than this	0
dont write while (true) { myFunction(); } in the console	0
haokay	0
computer went to 80% processor	0
ohmygod	0
thats my bad	0
well it's my bad also	0
the code is unsafe	0
i dont think so	0
it just tries to generate infinite circles	0
and after a lot, the tab crashes anyway	0
oh	0
i'm not sure why i cant stop it though	0
that's called the power of hanb	0
even if i pause javascript execution it still generates circles	0
nice	0
go hanb go	0
for (var i = 0; i < 10000; i++) { myFunction(); }	0
write this, this is safe	0
but curiously, the score doesnt update	0
what did you do	0
hahahahahahahahahha!!!!	0
handyc: why	0
the fuck	0
you know you are also generating negative scores, right?	0
and after 10000 iterations, mine balanced out	0
and my score was 0	0
score = abs(Math.floor(Math.random() * 100));	0
replace line 30 with this	0
Math.abs actually	0
you there, buddy?	0
it works now	0
try it now	0
everytime i refresh, something else changes	0
you working fast	0
yes	0
that's how I like to work	0
I am a sloppy hacker	0
how did you make the score always positive? i see no abs there	0
wow, I should makes this into an app	0
the score begins at 0 and then always gets a random number added to it	0
yes, but the number can be negative	0
oh I see what you are saying	0
oh, it is not	0
it is always between 0 and 1	0
that is what I thought	0
yeah	0
hmm, then why did i get negative score before?	0
then it is multiplied by a value and floored	0
I think I messed something up earlier	0
after 100000 clicks, it was still 0	0
previously score was not global	0
and i tried it to see, sometimes it was subtracting 	0
then I quickly made it global so it would be easy to save	0
i would click and would go from 56 to 43	0
nice	0
maybe that should be level 2	0
this could be the new flappy bird	0
i dont think so, but sure, i support you	0
prove me wrong	0
slap some ads on this bad boy	0
well, like I said, this was just a quick experiment	0
the real hanb is more complicated	0
now I can make the real one after seeing how this works	0
for (var i = 0; i < 1; i++) {	0
i love this line in particular	0
Mystique :(	0
Mystique :( 	0
im back now	0
im înapoi acum 	0
@auto off	0
all of yours auto translate rules were cleaned for this channel! 	0
oh god the logs are flooded! awesome	0
damn, mattf, you missed some shit	0
gasconheart sent me an audio	0
ProfilQ went psycho	0
yes!	0
oh no not him	0
wait ill check the logs	0
you missed all the action, mattf!	0
i am also half op now	0
orangeFlu: he *did* call you retarded.... there *were* grounds for a ban	0
did he?	0
i remember me saying i am retarded	0
and i am	0
oooh!!	0
maybe I am miss-remembering	0
my bad	0
yes, you are	0
okay	0
i called myself retarded, he just said i was born confused and he would rather be drunk than me	0
i wouldnt call those insultas	0
mattf: I felt I had to give @ to the trusted and responsible users to help me cope with the situation	0
ooh ok	0
sure, orangeFlu 	0
you will take it back? :(	0
mattf: I think we all handled it very well	0
hello	0
i lost it!!!!!	0
it was in my hand	0
I listened to his complaint, and exhausted it; not to his satisfaction; no one banned him, but he said he is not comming back; I am OK with that	0
i had all the infinity stones	0
it was temporary	0
mattf: you are temporary	0
orangeFlu: you had @ only for that session	0
there is no reason for it, we have more ops than users	0
fine	0
you dropped your schtrudel like a fool! :)	0
it felt good while it lasted i guess	0
haaaaa	0
i did it to make sure i still had it afterwards	0
but in my arrogance, the gods punished me	0
i flew too close to the sun	0
my name is Dickarus	0
Mystique got disconected, she can't get back here :(	0
oh, she is back now!	0
what?	0
what what?	0
welcome back Mystique 	0
what do you mean, she can't come back here. Why cant she?	0
thanks for your constant visits, Mystique!	0
Pffff, mi-a dat acatiste amicul tau :))))	0
her IRC app hung or something	0
nu mai e amicul meu	0
Thanks, gascon.	0
.tell loudercake for god's sake loudercake : @auto en ro   thats what you do goddammit	0
@ro I publicly renounce P.q	0
Am renunțat la P.Q 	0
My pleasure	0
Ok	0
this is a historical day	0
well	0
today we lost an enemy	0
:))))	0
the day Cristi came was memorable as well	0
but we gained an ally in Mystique 	0
also the day Cezar came! :)	0
are those 5 messages profiliq sent all you guys are crying about	0
let this be known!!!!	0
Haha	0
Mystique was always our ally	0
Sa imi dai nr lui	0
gasconheart: we just had a friendly connection, but today she entered NATO	0
oh he thought Mystique was a bot too	0
mattf: no...	0
I would love for the way the community handled today's incident to be a model from now on!	0
mattf, are you here?	0
im here	0
orangeFlu: ok	0
im checking the losg for what profiliq did	0
the community didnt do anything though, you did, what are you even talking about	0
Heeeey, I mised you	0
mattf: he said stupid shit	0
Mystique: you disappeared, dont do that...	0
Ohhh... ok	0
orangeFlu try it now	0
hanb.helxt.com	0
yes, but i am testing my own code	0
he was drunk or what	0
i took the liberty of modifying yours, handyc 	0
Mystique: what happened	0
mattf: we think so, yeah	0
nice orangeFlu 	0
I will put a simple version up on Git	0
github	0
then I can add variations	0
already I found many new interesting shapes	0
Mattf, what happened with what?	0
.tell loudercake: I will test it	0
i will give you this, it is much easier to cover the screen, haha	0
Mystique: with you	0
I was very busy here, at home, with my parents..	0
her IRC app went unresponsive, mattf, I thinl	0
*k	0
oh i see	0
we missed you	0
Really? :)	0
toilet break; brb	0
damnit, Mystique, i already told you we did :( 	0
I have to serve you a big cake	0
.beer Mystique 	0
well weird, profiliq used to be stable until now :P how unexpecte	0
yes, exactly what i said	0
Haha, orangeFlue..  it is nice to know it again and more	0
he used to be very polite and well put	0
handyc: give me more, i love this	0
make the canvas bigger	0
i am not sleeping today, not until i can play this game and master it	0
okay or	0
okay orangeFlu 	0
refresh?	0
Mystique: well i hope your situation is better now? is it?	0
Hm... sort of	0
try this one orangeFlu 	0
oh :/	0
hanb.helxt.com	0
Heeey, I watched Princess Mononoke, mattf	0
handyc: redirect http to https pls	0
Mystique: how was it ??? worth it	0
?	0
Yes, yes, yes	0
:)	0
handyc: so my vision is this: you generate random circles on the screen. These are ballons. And then you need to pop them. The bigger the balloon, the bigger the score increase. you add a "pop" sound and a chill soundtrack, and bam, millions of user	0
Mystique: well i guess that other one is your next then	0
what was the name... the one i watched	0
.rt Princess Mononoke	0
(mattf) Score_Rotten : 93  Score_Audience : 94  Rating : PG-13  Genre : ['Adventure', 'Anime', 'Fantasy']	0
oh thats a high score for rotten indeed	0
mattf: hot brunnette gets plowed by plumber?	0
.imdb Princess Mononoke	0
(mattf) Princess Mononoke (1997) ():  . unrated/10 with 0 votes. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119698	0
no orangeFlu that is not what hanb is really about	0
if at all ... I am sorry for P.q  :(	0
what is it about?	0
it is a universe	0
there are 64 levels to the universe	0
the levels are represented by the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _ and .	0
interesting	0
a is a piece of quantum foam	0
. is a universe	0
a... what?	0
No matter it is so old... since 1997, you can try to watch, mattf. My next one is Spirited away	0
each level is an exponent of meters 	0
Mystique: oh yes that one, i forgot the name! you will soon realize i have serious memory problems :P	0
.rt Spirited away	0
(mattf) Score_Rotten : 97  Score_Audience : 96  Rating : PG  Genre : ['Animation', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy']	0
so for example level K is 10^0 meters	0
K is the human level	0
even higher!	0
J is 10^-1 meters	0
I is 10^-2 meters	0
etc.	0
i got it	0
b is about the size of the Planck Length	0
Hahaha, so young and ... mattf	0
and X is about the extent of the solar system	0
Q is a continent	0
Mystique: I often go to the kitchen to pick up something and forget what i went there for :P	0
O is a borough	0
P is a province	0
you cant have lengths smaller than planck length though, not without our physics breaking down	0
yes I know, I accounted for that	0
you can use classical physics	0
you cannot	0
works for any length	0
why not	0
each level in hanb returns a hexagonal board with 61 cells	0
by works i dont mean being a representation of the actual word, just giving a result	0
it doesnt. because it does not acurrately describe how things work	0
or, alternatively, it could return an RGB value	0
sure, but then what is the point	0
hanb boards are 64 bytes long	0
they are 61 cells + an RGB value	0
orangeFlu: Games are not real life, i think that is the point of games	0
the board will return its RGB value if it gets to the bottom of a query	0
mattf, try to write a note on your skin before :)))	0
if it is not at the bottom it will return a 61 cell board	0
and then the query can occur on each cell	0
I write notes on the computer Mystique, otherwise i dont know what to do	0
so that you can zoom to any level of detail	0
like a zoom UI	0
like eagle mode!	0
yes	0
yes mattf	0
did you try eagle mode handyc?	0
I watched a video	0
i dont get it at all	0
I forgot to try it	0
okay orangeFlu 	0
handyc: try it, they have more things than the file manager	0
Thank God, mattf. Otherwise we won't enjoy your work :)	0
whats a "hanb" board, thats what i dont get	0
orangeFlu it is like a chess board	0
except it's not a square	0
it's a hexagon of 61 hexagons	0
that would explain the chessboard.js 	0
yeah I am not using that right now	0
i know, because i am getting 404 on it	0
so let's say you generate a hanb of size O	0
O is a borough	0
mattf did you see the update	0
im pulling 	0
oh ok lmfao	0
in this town called O there are many neighborhoods	0
each neighborhood is hanb type N	0
so each cell in the O board is N	0
loudercake: did you change the repo?	0
if you want to look at one of the neighborhoods,	0
i told you i did	0
then you can zoom in and you get a new board	0
what is it again	0
its just ant	0
then you are looking at type N	0
its on my profile	0
and that contains just M	0
and each cell is type M which I call hamlet or street	0
loudercake: where is your :gh bot	0
and then inside an M is an L which is a house	0
and in a house is a type K which is a humanoid character	0
ok, sure, i got the increase by a magnitude of 10	0
and inside the body of type K is type J organ	0
so the idea is that you will start at a particular level in the game and then have different encounters	0
so they are cells within cells withing cells, and every cell, depending on it's size (type M,N,P..) has a real life equivalent, like street, neighbourhood, etc	0
but one person could be playing as a king and doing stuff on a provincial level and another person could be playing as a god like entity and throwing galaxies around	0
yeah	0
but they are generated according to a palette	0
loudercake: seems you added some binaries....	0
so each hanb board is 61 cells, with one byte in each cell	0
its taking a time to pull	0
when you zoom in on that cell, the value corresponds to a palette	0
that palette is an association between a value from 0 to 255 and a 61 cell hanb board	0
:help	0
so for example, if a cell has value 6, then I look in the palette to see what kind of board is a 6	0
did you remove that command	0
however, there is also randomness	0
otherwise it would generate exactly the same stuff every time	0
my help? it was too much spam	0
:help	0
I am going to sleep guys... take care and have fun! See you soon.	0
gn	0
bye Mystique 	0
bye!	0
Mystique: oh pls come back tomorrow! :P	0
good night	0
Ok	0
couldnt you just dm the help command mattf	0
loudercake: i think i do if you ask in dm	0
but idk	0
i think im just not here actually	0
:join #romanian	0
i gtg	0
K is a person, L is a house, then haMlet, Neighborhood, O borough, Province, Q continent, R planet, S earth-moon system	0
cya in  a bit	0

it matches up pretty well	0
im not working....	0

 	0
solar system	0
the solar system is big	0
it seems to be about the size of X	0
if you include the Oort Cloud	0
T is about the size of the sun	0
if you would make earth the size of a marble, the distance between earth and moon is like 10 cm, while between sun and neptune would be 3-4 kilometers, so you are off by a few orders of magnitude	0
V is the distance to Venus	0
yes hanb is not perfect	0
so wait, S is earth-moon and T is the sun?	0
yes	0
doesnt T need to include S?	0
T is the size of the sun	0
well think of it this way	0
the boards are not storing objects	0
they are storing the potential for different kinds of situations	0
possibilities?	0
unlike chess, there are no empty cells	0
every cell has a value	0
that value is always recursive, down to the quantum foam level	0
quantum foam particles always return a random value instead of a board	0
and the value dictates how the thing inside the cell is generated + some randomness?	0
So uuh	0
Did you play it mattf	0
so because every cell is filled, some of the palette entries will have to represent things like blank space	0
but there is no such thing as blank space, there is always something there	0
so for example you are editing and drawing a village,	0
virtual particles!	0
you will have some spots in the village where you plant houses,	0
and some places where you put empty lots	0
but empty lots still contain stuff in them	0
so let us say we want to represent a universe in hanb,	0
everything in hanb is done on a 61 cell board, so let's put our universe in a 61 cell board	0
since a universe is type . then we can use all of the other letters to fill in the cells	0
. is the observable universe?	0
because every cell must be filled	0
yes	0
so let's say you have this string	0
assgAdkjhgkkjhgkgfgjAAAAJKHhhjkllAAALKJHXXXLKJHXXXLKJHXXXxxxkjhgxxgh	0
loudercake: i am, playing it now, i dont see the health bar	0
I do not know how many characters it is, pretend it is 61 characters	0
you can see there are some quantum foam particles in this universe	0
and some free atoms	0
those are A	0
then there are some larger things, I see a few star systems	0
handyc: just to make it clear, your go is not to make a physically accurate universe, just a simplified experimental picture based on it ?	0
s/go/goal	0
handyc: just to make it clear, your goal is not to make a physically accurate universe, just a simplified experimental picture based on it ?	0
so we can zoom in on those X star systems and see what they look like a bit closer	0
and maybe a star system contains this string	0
loudercake: where are the health bars?? we were all waiting on this patch today	0
ljhgkjhgkKHKJHGggHGkKKGHFGSCCHGYYYYyyyKJJGKKK	0
handyc: and most importantly where are the hexagons	0
mattf, it's not made to be a model of our actual universe	0
loudercake: also mouse controls!	0
yeah i kenw	0
it's like a toy universe for representing relationships between objects	0
yes that is awesome	0
the hexagons are those characters	0
is almost like my rpg programming language idea	0
so those strings can be placed on the hexagon board	0
express causality logically	0
yeah	0
I think it could work really well with your idea	0
we could try to present it together in St. Louis	0
they seem related indeed	0
just the idea?	0
well we can show examples like this	0
I think many people would find it really useful	0
yeah it feels it is useful but idk for what	0
because for example you can generate an entire universe instantly,	0
for certain search problems you could generate universes at different levels and unravel them only as you need to look	0
handyc: did you see loudercake little game btw, the kid is making progress	0
that's really good, mattf, I have seen him posting updates but I didn't play the latest one	0
how do I get it	0
but serious loudercake when i see this magnifying glass the first thing i want to do is to control it with mouse not arrows	0
git clone github.com:DanielDeSouzaMelo/ant.git  # handyc	0
thanks	0
it is an interesting idea for sure, but damn me if I see how this is useful	0
Daniel!	0
mattf: permission denied, public key	0
give me an https link	0
origingithub.com:DanielDeSouzaMelo/ant.git (push)	0
 	0
idk the https link	0
he didnt give me	0
he asked me to look on his profile	0
burn ants lol	0
ha ha	0
I burned an ant	0
instructions on how to compile?	0
or you know, do anything	0
no? ok	0
I also guessed mouse for the magnifying glass	0
orangeFlu double click on project.godot	0
and then click the play button when godot loads	0
double click where	0
did you get the repo?	0
i dont have a file explorer	0
yes	0
oh	0
dont i need godot installed?	0
i'm getting very little information	0
yeah you need to have godot	0
it's not a standalone executable	0
it's a godot project file	0
.tell loudercake https://github.com/matheusfillipe/Space-Explorer/blob/91504f192aacf1dfd7c16b5a322798e17a7da457/objects/Camera.gd#L99  use that to get mouse position but use InputEventMouseMotion instead and assign the global mouse position to the maginifying glass	0
orangeFlu: yay -S godot	0
godot project.godot	0
thank you	0
you're welcome	0
loudercake your game is similar to some of the themes in waiting for godot	0
What	0
I SAID YOUR GAME IS SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE THEMES IN WAITING FOR GODOT	0
Weird	0
Well	0
Gotta wait until tomorrow mattf	0
hgahahahahhahahahhah	0
very nice	0
Im at my stepmom	0
i see the healthbar	0
loudercake: why the life bar shows when it is already dead :P	0
it doesnt	0
not for me	0
are you running the game?	0
F5 to run the game	0
yes.....	0
weird	0
i already killed all the ants	0
to me it shows when the ant is burning	0
twice	0
not before	0
well, of course	0
why would it show before	0
you know the health is full	0
oh yes	0
then it should show while you have the thing over the ant	0
so you can know how long it will take or so	0
if it shows while the ant is already dead what is it for	0
it does while the ant is burning	0
not dead	0
yeah the ant is already dead then	0
it is	0
the state is dead	0
your job is finished with it	0
thats what i mean	0
Are you running the right version	0
i mean, in a way, sure, but im guessing this will be useful when the ant can extinguish	0
Did you clone it to the old git clone	0
oh will you be able to stop the fire on this game?	0
No	0
The ant	0
i cloned again	0
i'm guessing the ants can stop	0
Must	0
SUFFER	0
then why the bar shows while it is burning?	0
well then the health bar is useless either way	0
if they start burning and dont stop	0
not if the ant had an hp system or at least to show how close you are to actually burning it	0
i think it is a timer	0
Thats the point	0
To show how much time is left	0
so the progress bar could start going down and if you take the glass out the bar comes back up	0
oh, i see	0
yeah, it makes sense then	0
then the health bar now doesnt appear right	0
Ok	0
yeah i think this is not done yet then loudercake ?	0
Umm	0
im not with some glitched version here am i	0
Whats the health bar behaviour?	0
it appears when the ant starts burning	0
Yes	0
Thats the point	0
explain	0
To see the time left until the ants burn	0
so ants have full health by default. The health bar does not show up then. If you put the magnifying glass on it, their health will start to decrease. and the bar shows up to tell you how much until they catch fire. If you take the lens of it, they will start to regenerate	0
Ill make bosses	0
Theyll not burn completely	0
yeah i think exactly what orangeFlu said now	0
Uuh	0
Sure ill program it like that	0
well, is that the desired behaviour?	0
Ok i was kinda lazy	0
it is fine, that is the right way	0
The health bar is just get_time_left	0
you go slowly and lazy to get far	0
From the timer	0
i see	0
makes sense	0
But ok	0
oh you can reset the timer	0
But that would regenerate instantly	0
also, another idea: make the ants not walk using an orthogonal coordonate systems, it looks very very weird	0
indeed	0
you can have another regenerateTimer	0
when it ends it resets the main timer	0
hmm	0
no	0
i think its better it regenerates slowly	0
not wait and all at once	0
Well that should be a pain to code since i used timers	0
lesson learned	0
maybe the ant really needs an hp	0
var hp = 100	0
make your code easy to extend, dont put blockades where you dont need to	0
you have to anticipate these kinds of stuff	0
func _process(delta): if hovered: hp -= dying_rate * delta	0
if hp <=0 : burn()	0
Ok	0
think "if i wanted to add this feature, would my code be able to accomodate such a feature without rewriting half of it?"	0
Ill recode it	0
if the answer is yes, you are doing it right	0
Well i could make the timer be reversed i think	0
lose the timer	0
its not right for this	0
Ok	0
yeah timers are not good for things that have to continuously vary	0
 	0
Ok then	0
Ant rewrite itll be	0
Later	0
Since im not at the laptop	0
And i didnt brought it	0
rewriting is a constant part of coding 	0
i didn't bring it*	0
although, if you do find yourself constantly rewriting code... thats not good	0
think "if i wanted to add this feature, would my code be able to accomodate such a feature without rewriting half of it?"	0
Ok	0
make your code easily extendable while doing KISS and WET	0
its hard, but worth it	0
Whats wet	0
I know kiss	0
well maybe you are a genius guy that can write it perfect at first, salable, readable, without need to refactor, but i saw uncle bob himself saying that 50% of the job is getting it to work the other 50% is getting it to be actually readable	0
no, sorry, DRY	0
dont repeat yourself	0
you can sure get better with time	0
WET? :P	0
What does that mean	0
DONT REPEAT YOURSELF	0
DRY	0
WET is Write Every Time	0
:P	0
your code needs to be DRY, not WET	0
Could you say that again?	0
no	0
mattf: i'm not saying you have to write it perfect the first time, it's impossible. I'm saying that while rewriting and refactoring is good, doing it often is very very bad, and it means you are doing fundamentally something wrong	0
not thinking about extensibility	0
yes but that can also be a trap	0
because you can get stuck in feature forest	0
always imagining every possible use case and never writing anything	0
Thats why you plan specific feature aheaf	0
yeah and doing things like that always means spending more time	0
Lol all of this for an ant burning game lol	0
and maybe it wont even work	0
mattf: it is a lot more time, of course it is	0
i'm not advocating for any extreme here	0
loudercake: it is not about your game, it is about everything we will ever code	0
I know	0
Its just that the origin is funy	0
orangef and mattflu are both right	0
i'm saying think about possible features you might add, and accomodate the cod to be able to have minimal rewriting everytime you add something. This has the benefit that it will save you time in the long run, and 2. it minimizes regressions when adding something new or fixing a bug	0
yeah features that you might reasonably add	0
dont overengineer 	0
dont try to use some design pattern for something that can be solved in 10 lines without classes	0
my idea is, get it working first, or part of it, then refactor	0
overengineering is retarded for so so many reasons	0
Im not saying you shouldn't even think before starting	0
hey let's not use language that is offensive to retards, guys	0
but dont think more than you want to spend time doign thing	0
orangeFlu: there is a girl from that other server that wants to know you really bad!	0
I am a retard, im not offended :P	0
I called her here	0
oh shit	0
me too, not offended	0
mattf if you know you are retarded then how can you be retarded	0
what a lucky orange	0
gasconheart: i'm sorry, what?	0

gasconheart: what is her name?	0
well that's a different thing isn't it	0
orangeFlu: I talk about you to my buddies there	0

"vièt d'ase" means "doney's cock" in Gascon, and it is the proper term for "eggplant"!!!	0
loudercake: i will monkaW you	0
Sillicon valley hard drive bologna handyc	0
handyc: we might do a show on profanity in Gascon!	0
ok i dont know monka at all	0
i knew poggers	0
gasconheart I do enjoy profanity across languages	0
do you knowe NOPPERS?	0
nice	0
that is a great idea for a show	0
noppers? lol	0
what is profanity	0
the basic idea is that profanity is "degraded" in Gascon somehow! I mean, there is not a profanity comparable to that of other languages, since "profanity" became somehow normalized	0
is it the language I don't like to hear	0
good definition	0
Caralho...	0
if I like to hear it then how can it be profanity	0
something like that, loudercake 	0
fuck your mother's easter meal and her dead relatives' neck	0
profane language is often considered to be disgusting and also morally wrong, I think	0
and also impolite	0
in Gascon there is no real difference between "ass" or "butt"... they just have "cuu"	0
handyc: do you also bite your cats ears?	0
so again there is this perceived link between politeness, goodness and disgust	0
"vièt" is cock or just dick in gascon	0
yes I bite my cats	0
their ears and their paws sometimes	0

Ew	0
I think I am missing the "gâții", orangeFlu 	0
necks	0
it is a swear i have actually heard	0
among many others	0
And i thinking puta que pariu was the worst insult	0
Well besided slurs	0
"passover", namely "pastele" is a euphemism for, well, "c*nt"	0
loudercake: translate motherfucker....	0
its worst than "filho da puta"	0
Welp	0
americans say it like it is nothing still	0
Romanians do not have a "filho da puta" equivalent!!!	0
right, orangeFlu ?	0
"fuck your mother's easter meal and her pussy's necks" - that is the best translation i can do	0
hah	0
hijo de la puta	0
I tried to say "son of a bitch" to Romanians,	0
hijo de puta	0
what does it mean? gasconheart 	0
son of a bitch	0
"hijo de puta" in Spanish, right	0
fut-o pe mă-ta de curvă	0
I mean, you can translate "son of a bitch" to Romanian,	0
i have heard this one	0
close enough	0
but it is so not traditional as an insult,	0
that Romanians pause and think,	0
no, i guess not	0
after a split second they go, "hey, my mother is not a bitch" :)	0
@ro son of a bitch	0
Fecior de curva 	0
but it sounds much more vile than if you jsut said son of a bitch in romanian	0
hahahahah	0
fecior	0
to that extent "son of a bitch" is NOT an insult to Romanians	0
fecior!! hahahaha	0
fecior de curva!!! hahahahhaaa	0
so funny	0
ill add smt	0
but there you go	0
@en-ro something	0
most modern English speakers do not know the mundane meaning of the word bitch	0
no	0
you *can* translate that to Romanian,	0
@en:ro	0
but, there is no real traidtion of using that as an insult	0
to do it easier	0
long awaited feature...	0
fut-o pe mă-ta de curvă -- no, but this is an insult, and if you say it, guaranteed you will get your teeth knocked out, because it is not traditional and people are not used to it	0
just for context	0
we should have these conversations on Skype or telegram, boys, then make episodes for a podcast	0
we should!!!!!	0
do you have anything like I fucked your sister	0
people in romania are really used to hearing „fuck your mothers dead relatives”	0
let me say this please	0
i am so used to people telling me this, it is not an insult anymore	0
i wont bat an eye if somebody tells me this	0
fut-o pe mă-ta de curvă -- no, but this is an insult, and if you say it, guaranteed you will get your teeth knocked out, because it is not traditional and people are not used to it  <---------- yes, but it would take a noticeable long time for the guy to process it! :)	0
well I don't bat many eyes anyway	0
when people sling insults like that it is always silly	0
hey orangeFlu !! listen	0
POINT IS	0
if you use swear expressions that are normal and traditional	0
people will take it as a joke	0
because we are used to hearing them	0
orangeFlu: likely, yes	0
good point	0

can portuguese really compete with romanian?	0
what?	0
the "nu va suparati" thing!!	0
why	0
when you approach a stranger on the streets,	0
in Romania,	0
you have to say:	0
"nu va suparati"	0
i just realized how that sounds	0
haha	0
so: "don't get mad at me"	0
exactly!!	0
"please dont get angry at me"	0
exactly!!!	0
that freaks foreigners out!!	0
in lieu of "excuse me" like an englishman would say	0
yes I remember you telling me that	0
there you go	0
handyc: yes	0
we've been over this, handyc :)	0
good memory	0
yeah	0
thats because romanians are fucking psychos, makes sense to me	0
we should do THIS over Skype	0

orangeFlu: you never thought about it!! right??	0

i did not	0
wait	0
if you say, "Could I have X"	0
they will look at you funny	0

you take and leave?	0
No I think you just have to say it in a more decisive way	0
like if you are ordering a cheeseburger	0
"I CAN have X"?	0
you don't say can I have a cheeseburger	0
you say I will have a cheeseburger	0
or something	0
I am still not sure	0
both sound equalli fine to me, the first one seems more polite though	0

make a radio show?	0
im not good at talking	0
even on my own lang	0
Gravrila Neamtzu analyzed the Romanian vocative very well, orangeFlu; Romanian has a very interesting vocative	0
voice, mattf, yes	0
how so?	0
i could record, stream	0
like when we had our show	0
mattf: we used to have a voice show!	0
yes!!!! 	0
yep	0
orangeFlu thanks for playing hanb	0
played it, hacked it	0
got to a few million in scores	0
mattf: *we* do the talking, you do the recording; can you do that?	0
yeah	0
fantastic!!	0
what do you think, boys?	0
but im going to use espeak when i have to talk	0
can we do an audio show (podcast) one of these days?	0
in Sanskrit vocative is not considered a genuine case	0
:P	0
espeak? hahahahaaha	0
i have a very thick romanian/russian accent	0
be warned	0
gasconheart: we should have an icecast2 server!	0
hacking hanb is part of the game	0
our own anonradio	0
in Spanish vocative is also not a true case	0
we could	0
it's not difficult to set up	0
ive dont like 4 times	0
mattf: I sometimes broadcast my recordings with ... VLC	0
I even made an internal one once	0
done	0
and broadcast to my house	0
just apt install icecast2 and configure the mount thing	0
na	0
oh	0
recordings	0
gasconheart the question is, what are the criteria for determining if something is a true case	0
handyc: i have a sword, a potato and a bee, not really sure what to make with those	0
images of an 225 are out then :(	0
ha ha orangeFlu 	0
you saw the update	0
handyc: a "true" case has to be in OPPOSITION to other cases	0
it has to form a system with other cases	0
oh I see, gasconheart 	0
I think that is the reason that it is not true in Sanskrit	0
bingo	0
because it is too close to the nominative	0
same in Spanish	0
same in Spanish!	0
in Romanian it is really different from the nominative	0

never before noticed by Romanian linguists	0
yeah?	0
yes	0
the "self-vocative"	0
huh?	0
you should write a paper on it	0
I discussed it with Romanian linguist Gavrila Neamtu once	0
Eule?	0
I should	0
"eule"? no! but close	0
tell me	0
it is not a real case, but a function	0
it means,	0
naming yourself when talking to someone else	0
because,	0
that's not peculiar to Romanian	0
give me an example	0
it is "normal" to name the other person when you talk to them: "amice, vreau aia", "friend, I want that"	0
orangeFlu: I will give you an example	0
can you do it while rapping?	0
I got up the other day, 7 am, went to the cabinet and took a swig of vodka, then I thought, handyc what are you doing	0

okay I will give you another example	0
sorry for the spam	0
playing with the baby	0
daddy wants you to behave	0
I will say, 'handyz, you take this one, Dad, you take this'	0
so the father talking to the son can say "tata, ce faci"; meaning "father, how are you" but.... said by the father!!	0
handyc: pretty close!	0
i dont get it	0
"daddy wants" is not vocative	0
like if we are sharing a bowl of blueberries,	0
yes, my dad does say to me "dad, tell me what you did today", but idk if i would call that self-vocative	0
but still, in English you would need the whole "handyz, you take this one, Dad, you take this", while in Romanian they would say naturally "Dad, you take this" (said by the father)	0
I say, "handyz have one, Dad have one"	0
well sometimes we do, though	0
orangeFlu: it *is* a self-vocative, since he is not naming YOU, but himself	0
like my wife might say, "Okay Mom, get the milk"	0
it sounds off in english, doesnt really work	0
who does your wife refer to?	0
herself	0
as Mom	0
but no	0
"mamaie, esti bine?", literally "grandma, are you ok?", but it is the grandmother saying that!	0
because in my example	0
my dad refers to me	0
but he calls me dad	0
if it's referring to someone else, it's not self vocative, right?	0
and my mom refers to me as "mom", but she is the mom	0
orangeFlu: he does not call *you* dad, he calles himself dad!!	0
orangeFlu: no!	0
orangeFlu: your mom does not refer to you as "mom", but to herself!!	0
I am saying my wife on her way to get the baby's milk will often say, "Mom, get the milk"	0
when my mom says "ia zi, mami, ce ai facut azi?", she refers to herself? despite asking me what i did today?	0
like my wife might say, "Okay Mom, get the milk" <----- Does she say this when talking to you, handyc? then it *is* a self-vocative	0
She is speaking when I am there but as a kind of monologue	0
oh! it has to be a dialogue for it to be a self-vocative; that's the way it works in Romanian	0
well it could be considered as a dialogue	0
there is a hearer	0
but there is no need to be	0
It's sort of a performance for the kid	0
if it is a monologue	0
if it's referring to someone else, it's not self vocative, right?  <----- correct; by definition	0
well a monologue has an audience	0
no, in romanian it doesnt work like that	0
okay	0
orangeFlu: in a dialogue, in Romanian, an old lady in the market might say "mamaie, costa 2 lei"	0
in our house we also give human traits to objects	0
"grandma, it costs 2 cents"	0
if my mom says: "mommy, what did you do today?" she is literally asking me what i did today, there is no performance	0
so we might say for example, "Beans, get ready to cook"	0
jesus christ, it is chaos here	0
no it is not chaoes	0
chaos	0
gasconheart: explain better, i will not interrupt	0
it is super interesting	0
the liquor helps me make sens of this	0
it is super confusing and hard to follow when everyone is giving examples left and right	0
oh, we don't seem to have that type of usage in English, orangeFlu 	0
you start, gasconheart, we stay quite until you make your point	0
quiet	0
handyc: in English it does not seem to be traditional, but it is not impossible, as your interesting examples show!	0
thanks!	0
:--)	0
orangeFlu: 	0
people in Romania would say,	0
something like,	0
"mamaie, costa doi lei"	0
so, an old lady is saying "mamaie, costa 2 lei"	0
in English, "grandma, it cost 2 bucks"	0
who is she talking to	0
I heard that all the freaking time in Bucharest	0
she is talking to a prospective customer	0
to me, for example	0
oferring me her merchandise	0
but she says grandma for herself?	0
exactly	0
okay	0
yes, that does happen all the time	0
that sounds like the same thing orangeFlu is saying	0
that's why it is a self-vocative	0
but not like what I experienced	0
that does happen all the time, right	0
so my idea of self vocative is not the same at all	0
ok, now handyc makes his point	0
instead of using a real vocative: "young man, this cost 2 lei"	0
gasconheart: shut up, its his turn	0
it is not? hm	0
orangeFlu: alright	0
he isnt saying anything	0
well I don't really have much more to add, just that self vocative to me sounded like a vocative used to call the self, and we use it in this way to talk to ourselves and about ourselves	0
but it is not the same usage as what you are talking about	0
so I could look in a mirror and say, "handyc you are too old for this"	0
that kind of thing	0
it is not the same	0
ok, but it is pretty close, and I think it does fit the deffinition of "self-vocative"	0
then is it really a romanian peculiarity?	0
the peculiarity is that Romanians do that all the time	0
well we don't seem to have this granny it's two dollars thing	0
.wa most common female japanese name	0
(mattf) No results.	0
in other languages, though not impossible, it is really rare	0
exactly	0
parents to their kids, sellers at the market... grandmas, grandpas	0
yes	0
I've seen it only with "dad", "mom", "grandma" and "grandpa"	0
the thing i dont understand is this:	0
go ahead, son	0
you say, when an old lady says "mamaie, ...." she refers to herself. how did you reach that conclusion? if you ask her what she is reffering to by mamaie, she will say the customer, and i am betting i am right	0
the intention is to call the customer "mamaie"	0
althought it doesnt make much sense	0
ooh!	0
do you really believe that? orangeFlu 	0
yes	0
the old lady is calling a young male customer "grandma"?	0
I DON'T THINK SO!!	0
not by a long host	0
she is calling herself that	0
= self-vocative	0
i've called people "tati" before, as if i'm their dad and they are my child, and in my head at least, i was calling them "tati", although in the role play, i was the dad. And I think my parents would say the same	0
.w tati quebra barraco	0

I got romanian parents, this should be a very easy debate to settle	0
how should i ask them?	0
but orangeFlu, then, why would you be calling THEM "dad"?	0
i dont know	0
you were calling YOURSELF 'dad'	0
thats the part i never got	0
well	0
leave it up for the linguists to solve, son :)	0
hahahaha	0
Gavrila Neamtzu is a great guy	0
I met him in Spain in like 2019	0
I sent you guys pictures of our interview	0
remember?	0
me? lol	0
of course you don't	0
mattf: yes, you	0
its such a weird construction to me, this is the only explanation that makes any sense to me, and yet, it is still incomplete, because as you put it, "why would i call them daddy when i am the dad" i dont know, but i would liketo know	0
remember...	0
my construction is a kind of family joke, I am not sure if other people do i	0
it	0
orangeFlu: because you are not calling THEM "daddy", but youself	0
minran and I sometimes pretend like we are on a tv show being interviewed	0
so it is like part of the script direction	0
it seems like a term of endearment in a way	0
I love being out of context	0
orangeFlu: term of endearment or not, .... it is still a self-vocative	0
:)	0
gasconheart: but then, why would i refer to myself in that scenario? it makes as much sense as calling them daddy, that is to say, none	0
loudercake be careful because some people might start talking about philosophy	0
I dont think so *disappears from existence*	0
loudercake: mattf: it is like if I said "pai, fala comigo" but the dad is me, and you are the people I am talking to; so I am not sayin to you "son, fala comigo", but instead "pai, fala comigo"; I am naming muself instead of naming the person I am talking to	0
Is it like god or an actual father	0

What the hell are you talking about	0
Where did you get that from	0
I will ask my parents tomorrow: "When I was smaller, why did you, when talking to me, refer to me as "daddy"/"mommy"? Who were you reffering to with that name?" and I think we will get a clear indication of their intention, and therefore if it is a self-vocative or not. Because, after all, it's their intention that matters and who they think they are reffering to. If that doesnt satisfy us, I have a 	0

"child labour"? oh my	0
let me pose you this question i've been having	0
please	0
i debated with handyc some hours ago	0
ok	0
is it really child labour if we dont pay them?	0
oooh	0
no, it is not	0
it is worse!	0
child slavery	0
they are having an internship, with a competitive salary of 0 lei	0
simple	0
my entire childhood was based on this	0
ooh	0
does that mean my parents enslaved me?	0
we honored the principles of "you dont do as i say, you dont eat"	0
well, I don't think slavery applies to a parents-children relationship	0
i disagree	0
oh	0
I mean	0
yes, you *can* enslave your own kid, why not	0
i choose to belive my parents enslaved me. Either that, or there is no such thing as child labour	0
take your pick	0
so, every minor child is a slave to their parents?	0
anyway, i'm off to bed for the 3rd time this night. soon i will be getting PTSD from this 	0
yes!	0

i dont speak gascon nor italian	0
its fairly easy to understand	0
combine spanish with french and romanian and voila!	0
I was oversimplifying it as well	0
nice	0
hahaha kind of	0
handyc only knows how to say hi, good morning, good night, the verbs a fi, a avea and a vrea	0
and car and computer	0
that's a start	0
so we have to work with that	0
alright	0
ce mai faci, mașină?	0
salut	0
fantastic	0
so realistic	0
actually, that should be mașino, but i didnt teach him the  vocative yet	0
just the sentence every foreigner in Romania needs to know, "ce mai faci, mașină?"	0
its foolproof	0
you're right	0
did I tell you how I met professor Gavrila Neamtzu?	0
yes	0
no I did not	0
not the whole story	0
two times, yesterday	0
not the whole story, though	0
he was vactioning 200 meters from you	0
in 1999 I was living in Bucharest	0
thats all the details i need	0
listen	0
ok..	0
I bought an old book from 1989, about Romanian grammar	0
at the Vitan fleamarket	0
talciocul din Vitan ;)	0
never read it	0
2 lei?	0
I finally did, in 2019	0
ceva de genu'	0
20 years afeter I bought the book, 30 years after it was written... I finally read it	0
I was amazed	0
this guy has an awesome way of writing	0
seldom seen in linguistics, or even in other sciences probably	0
he writes in "thesis"	0
his book is a list of ideas	0
was the book in romanian?	0
he says something like: "well, is this a vocative or not?"	0
yes	0
then he analyzes why it can be a vocative, and why it can't, then argues and defends his view	0
so he considers everything before settling a matter	0
and all the book is like that... unbelieveble	0
so,	0
in 2019,	0
I thought, man I have to congratulate this guy	0
I assumed he might be an old person, or dead	0
I googled him	0
I found him	0
he worked in Cluj	0
he also had a radio show on Romanian grammar there	0
I emailed him,	0
I was honoured to get his reply!	0
I told him I am a Uruguayan linguist living in Spain, I had just read his book from 1989, which was awesome, etc.	0
the guy said, you know? me and my family are vacationing at Benidorm, Spain, next month	0
no freaking way!	0
that's where I am vacationing next month as well!	0
so we met	0
it was awesome	0
a real fluke	0
nice	0
that is the whole story	0
yes	0
the only one i can find is a gavrilă neamțu, born 1945	0
Babeș-Bolyai	0
that's him	0
how is he not dead	0
don't be that mean	0
my mom was born in 1943	0
not mean, but he is very very old	0
he saw the communist regine rise and fall in romania	0
my grandma's sister has just died, she was born in 1929	0
wow	0
your family is a different species	0
of Gascon stock, yes	0
you said you were expecting him to be old, which implies that he was in fact, not old... so i am very confused	0
what do you consider old	0
idk	0
perhaps I was not *expecting* him to be old, but just considering it was possible he might be too old to email or to even answer anyway	0
i had a 90 year old professor in college that used to email us the lessons he taught	0
everything is possible	0
nice!	0
he was completely geriatric though	0
without those emails, you couldnt understand shit	0
 Hey orangeflu	0

I feel uncomfortable asking users for favors regarding behaviour	0
anyway, orangeFlu, the user "little-lily" was visible, and you dropped an f-bomb! hahaha. Which is OK. 	0
Hello everyone !!! 	0
fowl language, like when we talk about chicks?	0
ken: old bastard, how are you	0
gasconheart: I am well, thank you for asking. May I ask a question 	0
handyc: yes!!! hehehe	0
gasconheart: yeah, but you were little lily, i saw you change your name	0
ken: don't ask anything please	0
personally I don't think you can police things like that	0
gasconheart: Yes you do 	0
how often do we talk about chicks really though	0
if you really want to set up bans on language, it has to be all or none,	0
orangeFlu: she was literally ripping the keyboard from my hands....	0
it should be an automatic kick on disallowed words	0
she usually would do that and then type under "gasconheart"	0
or otherwise, no censorship at all	0
I managed to change the nick quick	0
right, all or none	0
because you can't expect guests to know when children are present and when not	0
or a "censorhip" instead of a kick	0
that's right	0
I do a kick	0
on the #buddhism channel there are a few disallowed words, like n*, other racist terms	0
those will get an automatic kick	0
but not a ban	0
hm, so you can't even say "I fully agree that the word nigger is not allowed here"	0
what i dont understand is, why are children not allowed to hear certain words like this? i always thought it was so taboo to speak them as a child, then i realized, they are just words, and so, "pula" came out of my mouth everyday since	0
correct	0
somehow that does not sound right	0
well, its automatic	0
well, you point to an interesting problem, gasconheart, which I see as related to things like Gödel Incompleteness and the Halting Problem, etc.	0
how can you talk about disallowed terms without using those terms	0
how is it related to the incompletness theorem	0
but I don't really see any reason for someone in the #buddhism channel to say, "I fully agree not to use the word n*"	0
because you are trying to create a sanitized room	0
but you can't keep the rest of reality out	0
it seems to me a similar paradox to things like "who shaves the barber"	0
why can't you say "i agree it should not be allowed to say the n-word", and everyone knows what you are talking about anyway	0
the sanitization of the room depends on people being aware of what is not allowed, and to know what is not allowed they have to have instruction in an unsanitized room	0
because there are other words in English that begin with n	0
or you can use a different word to refer to that first word in the sanitized room	0
n-word is not offensive	0
yes, but that points back to the same problem again	0
somehow	0
but saying nigger is	0
here is something I found very funny	0
there is a comedian in the US, Louis CK	0
he had this bit	0
he said he saw on a TV show that people were debating about which word in English is the most offensive	0
and the candidates were something like "fuck", "shit" and "the n-word"	0
and his bit is just this,	0
if one of the words is so offensive that you can't even say the word for a point of reference when discussing if it's offensive, then that is the most offensive word	0
.yt louis ck n word	0
i think i read that somewhere, the name of the comedian sounds familiar	0
this comedian also became the subject of some controversy recently	0
because apparently he had a bad habit of masturbating in front of people	0
interesting	0
.w louis ck masturbate	0
(handyc) Louis C.K. :: Louis Székely, known professionally as Louis C.K., is an American stand-up comedian, writer, actor, and filmmaker. C.K. won three Peabody Awards two Grammy Awards, six Primetime Emmy Awards, and a... :: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_C.K.	0
hungarian name	0
thats why	0
oh yeah	0
i have a hypothesis here	0

if you have a hot friend, leaving aside the ethics of masturbating to other people than your wife/gf/husband/bf, do you think it is wrong to masturbate to her/him, without them knowing. No one knows but you	0
i dont know why but i find this fascinating	0
interesting question	0
well, I will tell you this much	0
I don't think of my wife while masturbating	0
it doesn't make any sense to me	0
while this is interesting, its not what i asked though	0
likewise, I almost never have a dream about my wife	0
well, the short answer is no	0
so it's ok	0
I don't think it's wrong, even if they do know	0
hmmm	0
and it's okay with me if my wife thinks about other men	0
my reasoning is that those are situations of fantasy	0
yeah, but we are not talking about the wife here. Even if you have or dont have one, the question is whether it is ok to masturabte to your friends	0
I would not want any of my Internet porn ladies to visit my house and actually meet me	0
you have a relationship with your wife that permits such behaviour, and thats fine, but others dont	0
oh I see,	0
so you are asking specifically about people with whom I do have a personal relationship	0
i'm not talking about porn stars, but friends	0
or more specifically, people you meet in real life, on a semi-regular basis	0
well, still not unethical in my opinion, but I would not be likely to think about any of those people like that	0
people from work, friends, acquaintances	0
for me it is very compartmentalized	0
interesting	0
my internal fantasy world is for me, it's not something that overlaps with reality to a high degree	0
i heard some very retarded opinions to this questions, but this is not one of them	0
what did other people say?	0
the stupitest thing i heard was: "yes, it is wrong, because the friends you masturbate to did not consent"	0
ha	0
which is really funny to me	0
neither do most of the people I wank to	0
who asks for consent to whack it to someone	0
well, except porn stars. they know what they are doing	0
they supply a product but they are not giving consent specifically to you	0
they gave consent in the sense that they agreed to be part of a porn	0
sure, okay	0
no, not specifically	0
but you could say the same about actors in general	0

handyc you befriended a duck in 12.585 seconds! You have made friends with 256 ducks in #romanian.	0
well, not really, because the consensus is that porn is for masturbating, but other movies are not, like say, Avengers	0
now you are asking for consent from the entire population	0
i do not	0
what if I like to masturbate to videos of aquarium fish	0
sure, you do you	0
that's my point	0
masturbation is a private exercise	0
the only consent is from me	0
of course it is, and you dont need consent for it	0
obviously	0
i am not arguing against you	0
yeah I know	0
I just find that response bizarre	0
consider a child playing with some toys,	0
he might put Mickey Mouse and GI Joe in a situation they were not in on TV	0
i dont like where this is going	0
this isn't about sex	0
i thought you were going somewhere else :)))	0
I am talking about how we create internal worlds	0
yes, ok	0
A child creates a world for Mickey Mouse and GI Joe, it's different from the promotion done by those brands	0
that child does not need permission from Disney or whatever to create that scenario	0
i dont know what GI Joe is, but sure, thats true	0
GI Joe is an army hero toy	0

toy? army?	0

of course	0

https://youtu.be/XGzZ6btr_ko	0
so my answer to my question is: i dont think its wrong to mast. to friends, but there is a caveat here. Sure, it is a private activity and you dont need consent from them, but you should not tell them. In that moment you implied them and they might not be ok with them. Technically, it wouldnt be morally wrong even with telling them, but we get to other discussions here. Like, say, it MIGHT be wrong to 	0
tell them because they did not ask for it and it may affect them. So masturbating to them is not wrong, but telling them is, because that is what affects them	0
not the masturbation in it and of itself, but the act of telling them is wrong	0
yeah, well that's different	0
because that borders on sexual harassment	0
yes	0
like if I had a sex dream about a colleague	0
I wouldn't say, oh by the way I had sex with you yesterday in a dream	0
and if it's something I brought about intentionally, much worse	0
because then it sounds like I'm trying to initiate something	0
so I agree with you on that, it's not something I would do, I don't think people should do that	0
the only exception would be if the person somehow asked, did you ever have a sex dream about me	0
that being said, i never masturbate to someone else if i am in a relationship. which is weird, i know, but thats how i function. I still am attracted to other women, but it doesnt go further than that. I think there is a mental hangup somewhere that i am not aware of	0
handyc: yes, agreed	0
well, that's your business, it's not for me to tell you what to think in those moments	0
what if they ask "did you ever jerk one off to me"	0
for me, if I'm in a relationship, I'm already in the relationship, so it's reality, it's no longer fantasy	0
handyc: well, you shared your experience, i shared mine so you dont feel left out	0
just like I would not normally have a dream about something mundane, like eating a plate of eggs	0
thanks orangeFlu, I appreciate that	0
you never dreamt eating something?	0
i dream about mundane things on the regular	0
if someone asked me, did you ever jerk to me, I think there must be some more context to it, so I think it depends on the exact situation	0
there is sometimes food in my dreams, but my dreams do not normally obey the same laws of physics or identity as my everyday life	0
so maybe there would be eggs in a dream, but I could be flying a spaceship or something	0
my point is that for me, fantasy is a way to push boundaries that I can't push in my everyday life	0
so there might be something exciting to me that is not practical or not really desirable to do in actuality	0
There is a nice movie, I wonder if you might like it,	0
at some point, i dreamt of chicken wings chasing me in the house of my dad's boss. They had knives made out of french fries. I was in kindergarten, i still remember it very vividly	0

i cant sometimes	0
it feels like when someone scratches a blackboard	0
Zizek says something in that film along the lines of, if our deepest fantasies were realized, it would be mostly terrifying	0

the things that people masturbate to, are often situations they would never ever want to take part in	0
for example, maybe I want to watch a video where 10 dudes gang bang some lady	0
but if I witnessed that in real life, it would probably be not fun at all	0

sure	0
I have not used TS before but I have heard good things	0
my knowledge of JS is very minimal	0
the supreme argument	0
yeah like how come Korea and Japan have different names, all the people look the same	0
what	0
TS is to JS what Rust is to C++	0
yeah that's what I have heard	0
nain..... ts is more bs than rust	0
ts compiles to js....	0
I am not a big fan of C++ but I am interested in learning Rust	0
whats your point?	0
what kind of crap is that, is just for adding types	0
my first "real" language was C	0
types are very important for writing safe, well documented code	0
when ts compiles to web assembly that will be cool	0
if that ever happens	0
but in fact you can make rust compile to ws	0
so js and ts and bs	0
it doesnt matter what it compiles to. and until wasm becomes almost universal, we still need to use javscript anyway	0
ts is so so much better	0
i have had so few headaches with ts compared to js	0

you can make a python to note the possiblity of every letter appearing in a certain position	0
yeah I could	0
and use those probabilities to make a word	0
generate a random number between 2 and 6, lets say	0
yes but there are a few problems with that	0
and that is the length of the word	0
one is that if I use a straight dictionary, it will only give me dictionary forms, no case endings	0
reminds me of	0

be warnt, ia do ave fick russian akcent	0
ah, no, just because romanian accent is just russian accent	0
they are so similar, i use russian	0
because people dont usually know what romanian accents sound like	0
I like the Romanian accent, though	0
i dont	0
I already told you, I used to listen to that Romanian guy on NPR all the time	0
he really doesnt have an accent though	0
very slight	0
if I can't understand you when you speak then we will have to get back on IRC to talk when you are at my house	0

orangeFlu you are such a typical engineer	0
telling me how to optimize my program for the wrong task	0
hahahaha	0
but I like your idea	0
romanians have a saying: "pizda e pizdă, dar calculatorul unul singur e"	0
what do you mean?	0
that character frequency type metric would be good for other things	0
what task	0
hanb	0
aa, yes	0
i dont think you can translate that, btw	0
you can try	0
google: "The pussy is the pussy, but the computer alone is"	0
deepL: "A pussy's a pussy, but a computer's a pussy"	0
it is a very weird order of words, not surprised	0
deepL is very wrong here	0
"Pussy is pussy, but the computer is only one" - in the sense that the computer is the true passion, and pussy is just a distraction	0
ha, okay	0
that's really a saying?	0
romanians must really love computers	0
i reordered the words to sound poetic	0
its not really, i say that	0
HA	0
you will see romanian is very flexible in its word order and ways you can say things	0
it feels like it is made for poems	0
I only use the computer so that I can automate things enough so that I can stop using the computer	0
Calculatorul e unul singur. Calculatorul unul singur e. E unul singur, calculatorul.	0
I used to think pussy was a distraction	0
I thought about ordaining as a monk a few times	0
what the heck is that, orangeFlu .....	0
actually right before I met my wife, I was seriously considering doing it	0
a romanian traditional saying	0
I think the mother goddess must have sent her to me	0
haha	0
Calculatorul e unul singur. Calculatorul unul singur e. E unul singur, calculatorul.  <-----  a traditional saying Romanians have been saying for centuries	0
yeeess	0
i was proving the different ways you can order words in order to sound more poetic or emphasize things	0
Sanskrit does that all the time	0
the word order is not very important	0
because it has so many cases	0
but it often goes subject object verb in normal speech	0
ramo vanam gacchati -- rama goes to the forest	0
gam -- to go	0
vana -- forest	0
interesting	0
locative?	0
vanam is accusative	0
ah, damn	0
he's going to the forest, not inside it	0
i guess "to" requires accusative here	0
but you could go in the forest	0
vane	0
just like german	0
those things can be tricky to guess,	0

orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 3.290 seconds! You have made friends with 150 ducks in #romanian.	0
likh on the ground with accusative is scratching a message on the ground,	0
but if ground is in locative, you will really be scratching deeply in the ground	0
likhāmi -- I write	0
so locative is for when you are deep into someone/something?	0
likhati -- he writes	0
no it's just for things being inside other things	0
or located on	0
oh?	0
anything involving location	0
sexative	0
yes!	0
"sexative" sounds accurate!	0
yeah you actually do love in locative	0
you love on someone	0

the verb for drink is used for smoking	0

how do you say: "i am not a virgin, someone took my seed before"	0
well, this is complicated	0
because in the ancient world men could not be virgins	0
only a girl can be a virgin	0
how do you say: "i am not a virgin, i took someone's seed in me before"	0
virginity in the ancient world is about having an intact hymen	0
let me check the word for virgin	0
https://sanskritdictionary.com/?iencoding=iast&q=virgin&lang=sans&action=Search	0
Title: Sanskrit Dictionary	0
ananyapūrvā	0
aham ananyapūrvā nāsmi	0
aham -- I	0
ananyapūrvā -- virgin	0
na + asmi, not I am	0
nominative	0
I think these would all be in nominative	0
I am X 	0
I think it always goes in nominative	0
but I have to check	0
my Sanskrit has become very rusty 	0
the past four years I hardly had a chance to look at any Sanskrit	0
there was a good meme once that would go very well in sanskrit	0
except for the fact that men couldnt be virgins	0
the second part would become something like,	0
previously I took the seed of someone in me	0
I took the seed, seed in accusative	0
me, in locative	0
wow, Pulp Fiction is on TV	0

damn, i almost forgot this meme, i first saw it like 8 years ago, jesus	0
I touched a boob and it felt like sandbags	0
what	0
no	0
there was a meme on reddit years ago	0
where some dork dude was trying to convince people he had been with a woman	0
but it feels like a cloud, its so fluffy and nice	0
and they said what did her tits feel like or something	0
and he said like sandbags	0
not fluffy necesarily	0
hahaha	0
yes, surely	0
yeah, boobs are great	0
I wouldn't say fluffy	0
I would say more like gelatin	0
bouncy	0
they are softer than any pillow and very bouncy	0
very hard to describe	0
and good flavor	0
yes, i dont know why	0
I often thought maybe I could market a nipple flavored vitamin water	0
maybe this makes me feel like a degenerate, but damn	0
well we're wired for it, right?	0
yes	0
you probably have that nipple taste coded directly in your DNA as a magic variable	0
var nipple = "good";	0
not everybody agrees though	0
there are also chemicals in breastmilk that are similar to opium	0
really?	0
well, more nipple for me, then	0
they are missing out	0
yeah, babies get high off drinking breastmilk	0
i love this 	0
is it illegal to commercialize human breast milk? i wonder why i dont see it in stores	0
actually some women produce way too much,	0
they freeze it and sell it to other mothers	0
i heard that	0
because some women do not produce enough	0
My wife had a lot of trouble	0
it was also very painful	0
she only breastfed for a few weeks before she gave it up	0
she even has one of those pumps	0
poor cows, they are bred to make as much milk as possible	0
but we just switched over to formula	0
the kid does not seem to care	0
actually I think he prefers drinking out of a cup	0
he's an old soul	0
maybe	0
well, this kid is already a local celebrity	0
why	0
when his mom brings him to the grocery store, adults come up to him and want to shake his hand and stuff	0
because he's so cute	0
you can tell me your opinion when you get here,	0
he does not seem like most babies	0
he will get all the ladies, i am sure	0
yes probably	0
i am still searching for all the ladies my grandma said i would have to fight off	0
she lied to me	0

yes my mom said I would need a stick	0

loudercake: any updates?	0
mattf: why do i get suffocated everytime i open the code	0
my god	0
some of it is good, but some of it is so weirdly written	0
well it is big	0
utils.py is sadly a real mess	0
i'm trying to think of a way to divide database functionality in different repositories	0
i want to keep DB class	0
and make some repositories based on purpose	0
I havent even gotten to utils...	0
not many bots ended up using that though	0
what is it used for?	0

flirtbot used it	0
.bef	0
orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 14.092 seconds! You have made friends with 152 ducks in #romanian.	0
well i wanted something like what telegram-python-bot does	0
but i made it in a hacky way	0
I'm back	0
if you notice, the total number of lines that do databse stuff is fairly big overall	0
but better than the default of telegram-python-bot that is pickling and saving to a file that gets corrupted if you kill their bots, but they also have a sql way	0
i wanted to split the class that deals with DB in more classes, but apparently its not worth it	0
orangeFlu: is the file sqlitedb.py there?	0
there is from another project	0
yes	0
wait	0
i have been looking on that for the past 15 minutes	0
haha	0
another project of mine, i just copied it there	0
so it isnt used?	0
most of it is not	0
thats a relief	0
only bot.py and utils.py are a worry	0
class IrcBot or whatever its called will be split into services	0
the big deal on this thing is fixing utils.py, all those cmd_whatever global variables hold functions 	0
each service has a purpose, and maximum 15 functions, MAXIMUM	0
otherwise it becomes a mess	0
orangeFlu: what do you mean by service	0
its bad already that this class alone has over 1000 lines	0
a service is simply a class that has a specific purpose	0
say some class does login stuff	0
orangeFlu: i was messing up with telegram client java android app	0
it has some classes with 15k lines	0
thousands of files	0
thats not healthy	0
no, i almost died	0
and gave up	0
but java is known for having shit long classes, both in name in lines of code	0
but come on... 500 lines is fine	0
:P	0
it is a very verbose language	0
mattf, don't give up so easily, if you almost died that means you nearly made it all the way there	0
push a little harder and you can probably die all the way	0
i love your pep talks	0
more than 2k starts getting reall ybad	0
thank you orangeFlu, it's my service to humanity	0
what does IrcBot do exactly?	0
this nothing, it holds utils and bot	0
in the summary, it says it joins a server and a channel	0
oh wait	0
got confused	0
the class with 1000 lines	0
the IrcBot class is the bot object, like bot = IrcBot("irc.dot.org.es", 6667, ...)	0
then bot.run()	0
this class does all 	0
authenticates, ping authentication, process commands (that come from utils global variables)	0
it is an irc client	0
i am very tempted to start over...	0
but there is good code there	0
start from scratch?	0
not going to do it, probably	0
there is a lot of features  there anyway, idk orangeFlu only if you really want to do this anyway, i created and i am not myself very tempted to do it ever	0
well, if i do want to split this class in a few, i need to really see where can i do that. if it all does irc server stuff, not sure there is much i can do to split it, it wouldnt make sense	0
its work for the sake of work	0
but surely there are some abstractions to be made somewhere	0
yeah idk how you could split that exactly either	0
like pieces of code that duplicate or something	0
honestly that is not the part that needs work, again, utils.py needs work	0
i mean priorities 	0
assert type(id) == int -- i am not a fan of this, at all	0
ok then, utils it is	0
so on utils a lot of variables are defined on global scope	0
cmd_* commands_* something like that 	0
they are dicts like "command_regex": function	0
and on IrcBot this is taken from that global scope 	0
yes, my brain is bleeding	0
i really am not sure what to do with this	0
so i think it would be better if you could in the end have a command class to wrap that up	0
then users can call those decorators in the command instance and it populate the class attributes 	0
and then have to change on bot.py so that it uses this class instead	0
on my view is the prior refactor that could be done and very meaningful	0
i need to understand exactly how decorators work, cause ive never made one before	0
that is cool then, if you can learn something :P	0
yes, IF	0
well it is a function that takes a function and changes its definition	0
then @decorator\ndef myfun(): ....   syntax is syntax sugar for: decorator(myfun)   except that it is also redefining it	0
you can make class methods be decorators	0
i think flask does it, django too	0
well the goal is have this easy way you can wrap a function with something in the end and take it into account, like to say, this function is for this command and then you write the function that actually handles it.	0
and one thing is right after the other	0
yeah, i understand	0
my biggest problem right now is how can i make this better	0
take the cmd_* commands_* globals, make them into properties of a Command class, make the functions that populate those globals methods of that class	0
is command the best name of it 	0
cmd = Command()   @cmd.message_command("start")\ndef start(...  bot = IrcBot(config, cmd)	0
kinda	0
i cant think of something else	0
also the IrcBot config would be cool, it just takes a lot of arguments the way it is now	0
i still want there to be an option to read a config.json	0
its much easier to modify that	0
nah python has thos 3rd party already.... 	0
what do you mean?	0
because this is just an initialization anyway	0
like dotenv or whatever	0
if there is a config class you can just: config = Config(**json.read(open("config.json")))	0
but yeah would be cool	0
oh, i see what you mean	0
oh man i shouldn't have eaten chocolates, i am blind now	0

no not the beginning of portuguese, im being stupid as usual	0
1500 is the earliest romanian document, so i canțt go further than that, but you can. I am curious how far back can you go before you dont understand it anymore	0
but no it is quite hard for me	0
interesting	0
maybe im just not alliterated enough	0
alliterated	0
romanian is quite well preserved, i think because we were pretty isolated usually	0
i hope i didn't just say im not gae enough	0
i have this corrector on emacs doing crazy stuff now	0
no, you did not say gae	0
poems are gae	0
lusíadas is a poem about sailors	0
also, very weird to me, if i look at the manuscripts, i cant understand shit, because it is in romanian cyrillic, which i have no idea how to read	0

boys, chat away! just let me say that posting URLs is perfectly OK in this community, and commenting about someone who posts URLs is also perfectly OK! The postings can be random, or not, they will anyway be welcomed. Flooding might be a reason to act upon... which it was far from being flooding.	0

mattf: let me op the boy for this session, I trust you will agree; thanks	0
orangeFlu if you are afraid of something in Romanian, does it take a special case?	0
ițm going to go, i need to make copies of my keys and print some things	0
for example in Sanskrit fear takes ablative	0
"fear from snakes"	0
handyc: no	0
oh, wait	0
but in English it's more like a genitive	0
it takes dative	0
"fear of snakes"	0
"fear to snakes"?	0
in Sanskrit dative works like this,	0
„mi-e frică de șerpi”	0
proper genitive is "snake's fear"... a different thing	0
"I give the sword to the king"	0
king would be in dative	0
that is dative if i am not mistaken	0
"to the king", dative, yes	0
yeah, snake's fear, that's why Sanskrit uses ablative for the other meaning	0
„mi-e frică de șerpi” - isnt that dative, gasconheart?	0
genitive, the fear belonging to the snake -- ablative, fear caused by the snake	0
the fear is coming from the snake, so it's like something coming out of the snake	0
anyway, i need to go, i have a ton of adulting to do today	0
will be back in a few hours	0
orangeFlu: the "imi" from "mi-e" *is* a dative	0
so yeah, fearing someone takes dative, handyc 	0
thanks, that is very helpful to me, I really want to make progress in Romanian quickly	0
it would be nice to be able to talk with people here without relying on the bots	0
so does hunger, thirst and sleepiness	0
cool, thanks orangeFlu 	0
but in Romanian you express the one who fears with the dative; beware	0
I am going to go and get some groceries now	0
the fearer is in the dative?	0
"I am affraid", Romanian "imi este frica", literally: *"fear is to me"	0
oh nice	0
that is also similar to Sanskrit,	0
the fearer! yes :)	0
mi-e somn, mi-e foame, mi-e sete, mi-e frică -- in that order, i am sleepy, i am hungry, i am thirsty, i am afraid	0
mattf orangeflu i dont know where to even begin with the ant health rewrite	0
and Hindi	0
diseases happen to you	0
in English we like to be in charge of things and own things, so we HAVE diseases	0
in Indian languages those kinds of things happen to you in a passive way	0
diaseases work the same in romanian - we have them	0
ok, im done	0
orangeFlu: in Spanish we express all those with the verb for possesion, "to have"; "tengo hambre", "imi este foame", literally: *"am foame"	0
so fear happens to you but diseases you actively have	0
I guess because it is an emotion and not a physical thing	0
"I am foamy"	0
hahahaha	0

time to patch 	0
she is upset because our son does not want to eat anything	0
my feeling is, that's okay	0
but she thinks he has to eat a specific amount every meal	0
which is wrong	0
she is mad at me for not force feeding him	0
we already talked to a doctor about it and the doctor said do not force feed him	0
interesting	0
i had the same issue	0
you mean when you were a kid?	0
it seems to me that it's normal for kids sometimes not to want to eat at all	0
and the doctor confirmed that	0
she is acting like he is going to die if he skips a meal	0
I mean my wife is	0
He has a little diarrhea yeterday and seemed like he was not feeling well	0
so he basically did not eat dinner yesterday	0
and he does not want dinner today	0
but he has been drinking milk, and he ate lunch	0
yeah i was one of those who didn't eat much	0
until i was 17 actually	0
i didn't have any fat	0
my grandma would always say im too thin, like every single time 	0
and try to force feed me	0
and she was angry that my mom stopped giving me mother milk at a too young age... and she is pissed about this untilt oday	0
my wife also stopped breastfeeding very early, because she was not getting enough milk to come out	0
so we put the baby on formula	0
oh	0
this kid is pretty small, but my wife and I are also small people	0
the doctor said his growth chart looked completely normal 	0
yeah	0
my wife told my son that if he doesn't eat within 30 minutes, she will take away his food and he will get nothing	0
but then he doesn't eat in 30 minutes, and she just keeps trying to feed him	0
because she is afraid he will starve	0
then she just shouts at him	0
hah	0
the doctor said this is the worst thing you can do, because then he will associate eating with being shouted at, and he won't want to eat anything even when he is hungry	0
well you are making she look like a feeding maniac now	0
she is a feeding maniac, mattf	0
and become obese	0
this is why I have gotten almost nothing done since I left my last job	0
yeah my mother claims that is the reason my father is obese :P	0
I wake up every day to her shouting at him	0
then when I get ready to start my day, she shouts at me to help feed him breakfast	0
then if she thinks I am too slow, she shouts at me to feed him faster	0
then by the time we finally get him to finish his breakfast, it's almost time for lunch	0
same situation	0
and then dinner	0
well it is just a phase	0
same situation	0
your son is healthy	0
and then we go to bed, and it takes me a few hours sometimes to get to bed	0
so this is why when you ask me where my donuts are,	0
my mother still have to shout with my brother constantly and he is 16 now :P	0
well, ask my wife where they are	0
yes, it's a phase, it will pass	0
that is why I am not taking it in a very stressful way	0
but she is freaking out	0
fortunately we have enough money that it is not an emergency for me to be out of work right now	0
but I feel like a robot that just feeds a baby and then sleeps	0
i developed the habit of sleeping each time later because of all the shouting 	0
yes, I think that is what is happening to me as well	0
once my brother would wake up it was a hell	0
I had been getting up around 9:00 am every day, now it's more like 10:30 am	0
the only time I can get any work done is when they are both asleep	0
but by that point in the day I am usually too exhausted to do anything at all	0
so then I just read Hacker News until 2:00 am and go to sleep	0
:P	0
and repeat the same process again the next day	0
im stuck on that sort of vicious cycle as well	0
Covid is making it much worse	0
im each day more exhausted 	0
We don't really have any support network here	0
I leave the house a couple times a day to get some fresh air	0
My wife has barely been out of the house without me and the kid for the last two years	0
We haven't had anyone over	0
We haven't gone to anyone else's house	0
well a few times we did	0
we've been like that for 2 years too	0
but mostly we are sitting in here like a prison	0
damn, me too	0
orangeFlu will be our first real guest in a long time	0
i am in a vicious cycle	0
i'm scared	0
probably we will forget all the social rituals and accidentally eat him or something	0
i am thinking what to do to guarantee my wellbeing	0
yeah	0
well, that's one reason I get on IRC	0
otherwise I would not have anyone to talk to at all	0
i only talk with you guys and tina 	0
The only people I know very well in this country are my former students and colleagues at the university	0
at least i know his name and address, it will go to my mom just in case (hear that, handyc? you cant eat me or keep me a slave)	0
Some of those people I plan to keep touch with, but most of them no	0
orangeFlu we will probably clone you prior to eating you	0
thats ok then	0
then we just send the clone back	0
he will not have any memories of what happened, because we will do the clone prior to any kind of violence	0
can you eat the clone thou?	0
and let me walk	0
orangeFlu clone meat just isn't the same	0
if you are going to eat a person you have to do it right	0
eating a clone, it's like cheating	0
it's like lite beer	0
how about this, I will make you a deal	0
we will just eat your top half, then you will still have legs, you can walk	0
we will eat the legs of the clone and mix it in with the rest so it doesn't alter the flavor too much	0
thats fine i think	0
probably we will need to add spices	0
i see no reason why we wouldnt do it this way	0
oooooooooh	0
i get it	0
thats what the spices from the hot pot are for	0
we can attach the clone's upper half to your legs and then it will be more or less like nothing happened	0
i only talk with you guys and tina -- that breaks my heart	0
hah	0
well and with my clients	0
i can't find enough time to hang out with the people i want, and some of them are sad because they think i dont want to hang with them anymore	0
i simply cant find the time	0

i never hang out	0

are sysadmins usually racist?	0
is that a new stereotype?	0
many of them are, in my experience	0
cool	0
good to know	0
I am not sure	0
I don't think of myself as racist	0
but they would probably not think much of me as a sysadmin either	0
there are a lot of autistic people in there	0
me neither, but damn if i wont tell 5 racist jokes per minute	0
I don't have a problem with racist jokes 	0
I think most of them are probably not as racist as they pretend to be	0
it seems to be a kind of performance	0
if the joke is not challenging something, i dont find it that funny	0
yeah, well I don't generally tell any racist jokes outside of a discussion about racist jokes	0
for example I had a Jewish friend, we would talk about these things and then I would tell him jokes about Jews	0
was he amused?	0
yeah, he enjoyed it	0
do you have romanian jokes?	0
i dont think i ever heard one	0
No, none	0
ok, maybe i did, but very very few	0
because most Americans don't know anything about Romania	0
but people used to tell Polish jokes	0
uuu, i want those	0
about how dumb Polish people are	0
most of the jokes are also pretty dumb	0
ironic	0
like did you hear about the Polish guy who wanted to fly a spaceship to the sun	0
no	0
they told him he would burn up, but he said, "It's okay, I'm going at night"	0
i swear to god, i heard the same joke but with blondes, albanians, russians	0
of course	0
everyone has some group that they use for this kind of joke	0
we have two different words in romanian for jokes	0
oh yeah?	0
one is for dumb jokes like these, that you can easily find compiled online and are generally dumb as fuck	0
right?	0
they are called "banc"	0
banc	0
okay	0

he did this like ten times	0
"pizda mă-tii` - did you say that?	0
I said, "Hey, are you almost done? Other people want to use the machine"	0

never heard the term	0
i knew one at some point	0
A boy owned a dog that was uncommonly shaggy. Many people remarked upon its considerable shagginess. When the boy learned that there are contests for shaggy dogs, he entered his dog. The dog won first prize for shagginess in both the local and the regional competitions. The boy entered the dog in ever-larger contests, until finally he entered it in the world championship for shaggy dogs. When the judges had inspected all of the competing	0
 dogs, they remarked about the boy's dog: "He's not that shaggy."	0

oh I know one like that about a moth	0
There was this moth	0
He was really depressed 	0
Super depressed	0
His wife left him	0
And his son died	0
and he became an alcoholic	0
but people already know the final joke, which makes it all the more funny, because you waited 5 minutes to hear a joke you knew already	0
So he went to a doctor,	0
he is telling the doctor all these things,	0
how his life is so bad,	0
he was even thinking about killing himself at one point	0
and after hearing his story, the doctor said, "Well I'm sorry to hear about that,	0
but you know I am a podiatrist and not a psychiatrist, right?"	0
He says, "Yes I know, but your light was on"	0
hahahahhahaha	0
why does he mention being a podiatrist?	0
does that have relevance?	0
because he went to the wrong kind of doctor	0
he went to the wrong doctor, but he didn't care because moths always go to a light	0
he could have just said "i am not a psychiatrist"	0
well it's funny because podiatrist sounds similar to psychiatrist but is a completely different type of doctor	0
i was also expecting a foot joke somewhere	0
well the best presentation of this joke, I will show you	0
poor moth	0

youthful purpose, he said?	0
the second one is funny hahaha	0
handyc: lämp is lamp, like a light lamp, but written with ä for no reason. it was a trend back then in memes to substitute letters with some accented version of it to make it look and sound funnier, implying that the moth did not know english that well and it was a foreigner	0
honestly, for me, it made the meme 100% funnier	0
i know my dad didnt get this trend, but it was very funny to us	0
still is	0

I took some zoology classes in high school	0
not in my wardrobe though	0
the teacher was this amazing guy	0
so did we, but it was mandatory	0
invertebrate zoology is one of the best classes I ever took, because of this one guy	0
we had to make our own insect collection	0
i dont want that	0
we also dissected a bunch of things	0
well it was very educational	0
I dissected a giant grasshopper	0
i did that in 2nd grade, no thank you	0
I took vertebrate zoology also	0
you did dissections in 2nd grade?	0
since then, i have a phobia of bugs	0
yes	0
oh the collection	0
both	0
really	0
wow	0
I would not expect to give a scalpel to such a young kid	0
we had a communist teacher, and she was really like, you cant learn if you dont do this, like i did when i was small	0
wow damn	0
that's amazing	0
we didnt use scalpels, just a normal knife and needles	0
the biggest things I dissected was a fetal pig	0
it was pretty stinky	0
*thing	0
i hated it though	0
I did not like it too much at the time, that smell	0
that formalyn smell	0
and those gross black trays that you stick the pins into	0
it was all very disgusting	0
we also had to make a book with plants and leaves, "ierbar" we called it, because it contained grass - "iarbă"	0
the organs did not disgust me,	0
just that chemical smell	0
I was thinking about becoming a surgeon at that time	0
I had pretty steady hands, I think I would have been a good surgeon	0
i never minded formalyn or formaldehyde, whatever it was that we used	0
but I am glad I didn't do that	0
me neither	0
formaldehyde I believe was outlawed in the US long before I was in high school,	0
it's carcinogenic	0
maybe not outlawed but not allowed to be used in those school experiments	0
i promised a neighbour of my grandmas that i would become a cardiologist when i was small	0
because she had heart conditions	0
and i would make her live longer	0
hahaha	0
well, when will you be small enough to achieve your dream?	0
i was small back then, in primary i think	0
she is still alive	0
90 or something	0
but even if i went to medical school, i still wouldnt be close to helping her	0
I am still pretty small, maybe I could be a cardiologist	0
go for it, man	0
I guess they need short people to fit in there and really get a good look at what the problem is	0
how short are you	0

you basically said you break the pipe by bouncing over it :)	0
gae	0
ask me gasconheart ! lets see if i can help you	0
how do i echo something?	0
here?	0
I don't want public humiliation	0
you are amongst friends	0

when I swaped to the other Pi, I installed Apache	0
which you didn't	0
we use nginx there	0
on the container	0
port 2236 is for the host, regular port for the njinx container	0
so portts 443 and 80 are occupied	0
ok good	0
I did	0
wait	0
reverse proxy?	0
n jinx :)	0
it loads the index.html pages and little more,	0
apache is working	0
for many other things, it says 404 object not found	0
http://www.dot.org.es:2236/~gasconheart/   <--- works	0
i see the index of page	0
thats 404 to me	0
http://www.dot.org.es:2236/~littlelily/    <---- also works	0
oh wait wrong 	0
:P	0
both are 404 to me actually	0
gasconheart: are those symlinks, how did you set that up	0
whats your apache config like	0
those are not symlinks	0
my apache config file right now is a mess	0
those folders are on the root	0
so maybe thats wh	0
how come you get a 404 there??	0
i do	0
ctrl + f5 on your end	0
I think you're right; hm	0
why do you have a messy apache config	0
set the Documentroot properly, create a directory block, if you need paths for weird locations create symlinks and add Options +FollowSymLInks	0

mattf: indeex, there are freaking symlinks there; that is the next, and last, step	0
i think mattf gave up	0
handyc: you never came back	0
just like my dad	0
when he went to buy "lapte"	0
hi orangeFlu 	0
cigarettes?	0
you did come back, did you get the milk?	0
"țigări" 	0
oh, milk, that makes more sense	0
that is cigarretes	0
like leche	0
lapte leche	0
what language is that?	0
I wonder if there is some relationship, seems to be	0
Spanish	0
also, i did want to share something with you	0
my son is not feeling well the last two days,	0
so it took him longer to get to sleep than usual	0
yesterday i was going in the archives of romanian manuscripts and documents	0
I just sang the ABC song about 30 or 40 times	0
he would not let me stop	0
he calls this song A	0
every time I would stop, he would shout, "A! A!"	0
and was reading the oldest romanian document we can reliably date, the letter of Neacșu from Câmpulung, and i realised something very weird	0
oh yeah?	0
a noble from Câmpulung wanted to warn the mayor of Brașov, then part of Hungary	0
that the turks where planning on invading hungary	0
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neac%C8%99u%27s_letter	0
Title: Neacșu's letter - Wikipedia	0
anyway, and i realised, damn, i can fucking read it	0
i mean, i can't, because it is written in cyrillic	0
but if transcribed to latin	0
i can understand it really well	0
foreign scripts are not so difficult to learn	0
and it made me wonder how did romanian conserve so well	0
I bet you could learn Cyrillic in 2 weeks	0
i know cyrillic	0
I learned Devanagari in 2 weeks	0
oh	0
just not romanian 1500's cyrillic	0
oh I see	0
yeah, makes sense	0
which is different, and i am not going to learn that as well	0
yeah, not enough time for everything	0
but why did romanian conserve so well?	0
so i asked mattf 	0
if he could understand a portuguese poem from the 1500's	0
he said no	0
right	0
he said "it is something about ships"	0
it would be like me reading Chaucer	0
and i know i tried to read Shakespeare and damn, if it isnt very hard to understand sometimes	0
granted, i am not a native speaker	0
1521, I guess it would be more like me reading Shakespeare	0
yeah	0
but if i cant understand it well... surely you wouldnt have much more luck than me	0
I tried to read Macbeth	0
fuck me	0
anyway, i can't find much on why romanian is so well conserved, apart from maybe the fact we were kind of isolated	0

Sent forth great largess to your offices.	0
what the fuck is this shit	0

if i read this, at the end, i would be like, so what the fuck is he on about?	0
largess is money	0
he came into a large amount of money and sent some to you	0
how...?	0
that's a word still in use today	0
which one	0
largess?	0
yes	0

i didnt know this	0
it's not just that,	0

our will is what we want	0
okay	0
defect is to leave something	0
servant is servant of course	0
oh, yes, that is true	0
as a former soviet you should know defect	0
haha	0
i wasnt alive during the soviet union	0
well close enough	0
surely you have heard of people defecting	0
10 years apart, wouldnt say close	0
yes, from the army, only in movies	0
i know the word	0
just didnt think it would mean this	0
I would say this kind of language is not entirely simple for me, but the meaning is also more clear in the context of the whole play	0
interesting	0
it's also poetry, so that makes it weirder,	0
but it also helps it flow, 	0
okk, let me show you this	0
you can read something like Shakespeare and not understand all of it, and just keep going	0
then you might realize later on what something earlier meant	0
i am going to give you a fragment of Neacsu's letter	0
and then translate it to modern romanian	0
it will be very different, but you have to realise	0
the flu in yellow-red doth protest, too much I think about the ancient text	0
that it used very archaic words, that while we still use today sometimes, we have newer words	0
like corăbii and bărci	0
they mean the same thing	0
boats	0
what grippes him is the diction of the past, but ere the morning comes he will understand at last	0

look in your pm, handyc 	0
gasconheart did you read the log?	0

because vampires dont die	0

mattf, earlier you said a beetle and now you are changing your story, what else is changing, are your limbs changing into beetle limbs	0

i did not	0
i cant risk not waking up haha	0
you can have ... an alarm	0
you could have had	0
plus i need to be extra early because i need to checkin my luggage, and there is a long long line there	0
i dont wake up on alarms	0
do you need covid passport?	0
when a friend slept over once, he realized that i've been sleeping for an hour with alarms going up and down in my room. He woke up from those alarms, in the other fucking room, with the door closed	0
i dont know how	0
i dont know what a covid passport is	0
oh awesome	0
i mean vacine	0
yes, i do	0
you need some sort of special passport	0
idk if that is needed inside EU	0
i need the vaccine green certificate, which is certified by my government that i have all the vaccines and a signed release form for the dutch that says i dont have any symptoms	0
nah, no passports here	0
no visas	0
oh yes	0
i just show my covid certificate, id, signed form and thats it	0
by id, i mean identity card	0
i see, cool	0
with visas there was a whole thing cause you had to wait for it to get approved, it was really shitty	0
now i dont need to prepare anything beforehand	0

(orangeFlu) 06:12:11+0200 Europe/Bucharest - Bucuresti - Romania	0
:P	0
so i was here at 4:50	0
now its 6:12	0
you are the crazy early guy	0
and my plane is at 8:35	0
holy shit :P	0
yes, because a friend of mine told me, and i quote: "if you have luggage, the line is extralong, so you are going to have to go early"	0
and i said sure'	0
i fucking believed her'	0
i see	0
so i went	0
and i ended up staying in the line for 10 fucking minutes	0
while i thought i would stay at least an hour	0
it moved too quicky	0
but anyway, i got some coffee because i am exhausted from not sleeping	0
and sat down with my laptop	0
my back kills me	0
all my electronic equipment is in my backpack, you see	0
i see	0
i would try to hack some airport wifi and see what i can do	0
but my network card doesnt support network mode	0
so those are things you can carry with you all the time	0
a backpack	0
yes, you got 3 types of backage	0
the backpack, which has some very limiting on dimensions, but they are forgiving	0
they let you in with bigger ones	0
i see	0
then there is the luggage you put in the overhead bins	0
im kinda scared of the luggage thing	0
so many stories of things having lost forever	0
those are very strict, but at least you get your suitcase with you and not forgotten somewhere	0
if you have these two, you wont lose them	0
because they are near you	0
and then there is the checked-in luggage	0
i see	0
which you must hand to them, gets a tag and gets put in the belly of the plane	0
those get lost	0
and i have exactly that	0
so if i lose it, i will need to buy clothes from the netherlands, which i wouldnt really do	0
plane belly :|	0
what else do you call it	0
so you would say an a380 is an obese plane	0
but not a beluga	0
yes	0
beluga is like a camel	0
but the 787?	0
that one is thin	0
but it has a good ass	0
yeah	0
the a 340 is that friend that is overgrown 	0
the concorde is like a very thin girl that talks too much	0
hahahaa	0
and died on her teenagehood...	0
because did things too fast	0
yes, unfortunately	0
and wasted too much money	0
but there is talk supersonic travel will make a comeback	0
yeah they are trying	0
actually, it didnt waste money	0
it was very very profitable	0
but	0
it had very bad luck	0
when one crashed	0
no too high fuel consuption	0
too low number of passengers	0
and people dont actually need to travel supersonic	0
and it crashed because another plane left a piece on the runway	0
people want to travel cheap	0
in the 70's 80's planes were like little casinos, palaces, whatever	0
and yet, in the 6 months before its demise, it was the most profitable time period for the plane	0
you could even smoke inside	0
yes, i know	0
i wish i could have gotten the chance	0
but only real rich people would fly	0
people do need to fly supersonic when the jetlag from flying longhaul is so damn rough + it gets you faster	0
yes, the fuel consumption was a bit much	0
but they made it work	0
it wast particularly unprofitable	0
plus, these days, with the engines we got	0
nah most people dont care about fast...	0
it owuld be so fuel efficient..	0
most, prbably not, but if you are a business man who travels to asia or something similar, its worth it	0
i wonder how the prices will be then	0
then you are rich	0
and not a majority	0
so is business class, for the richer	0
but people still fly it	0
a lot of people	0
yeah 	0
this coffee fucking sucks	0
jesus christ	0
well of course if you are too rich and needs to tour then you might as well get your private jet	0
which is where want to be	0
actually no	0
i want to be more like.... the damn name	0
theer is a big gap between being rich and being rich to afford a private jet	0
the forest gump actor	0
tom hanks	0
yes!	0
captain scully?	0
he has his own, is it is a 737?	0
he has a 737??	0
no the guy has a commercial plane	0
i think bigger	0
why the fuck	0
or maybe im confusing the actor	0
john thavolta has a 707 !	0
an oldie	0
what the fuck	0
what does he do with it	0
oh i think i was confusing with him	0
does he fly hookers with it	0
he is the guy with the airport	0
he has an airport on his house	0
idk why i confused him with tom hanks	0
it should be illegal to have that much money	0
oh he is a pilot	0
cool	0
it should not	0
honestly, nobody but presidents and governments needs airports on their house	0
if you had you would love it :P	0
lets picture your startup succeeds	0
and you work 10 years for it	0
its a waste of resources + the wealth inequality is already bad enough	0
then you think you acn finally rest	0
and the govenerment comes and say "sorry but you are too rich"	0
it doesnt work like that	0
why not	0
you think most of this people are just lucky?	0
you make taxation so that one person can not make more than a few millions per year, let's say	0
progressive taxes they are called	0
a very good idea, that the nordic countries implement	0
people dont get super dupper rich	0
they get rich enough	0
i hate that kind of idea	0
and they live very very fine	0
thats something the communist parties here want	0
they are the happiest people on earth	0
i dont want communism	0
the jump from progressive taxation to communism is very long	0
its part of it, sure	0
but not communism	0
its pretty stupid	0
nordic countries implement social measures and have social welfare and everything, and it works fucking great	0
maybe the guy opens a new company with it, gives jobs to more people	0
you are putting limits on how much someone can grow	0
yes, exactly	0
he is not necessarily a bad person	0
you know why?	0
because you cant spend the money you have	0
and wealthy people tend to accumulate wealth	0
thats dumb	0
accumulating wealth is dumber	0
it is not that much 	0
because the money sits and does nothing	0
it can't cure africa or something	0
what will that state do with it	0
therefore it cant be used for other things	0
make social programs, renovate, invest in projects. if you have a good government of course	0
then you do it to corrupt politicians so they can be rich too	0
if you have corrupt politicians it wont work	0
yeah maybe on norway that works	0
i agree	0
this would never work with american people	0
but people accumulating that kind of wealth is not good	0
no, because americans are dumb as fuck	0
and they made bribing legal	0
im talking about all americas	0
its called lobbying	0
ah, probably, yes	0
we are not dumb exactly but very ..	0
imagine	0
how dumb the average person is	0
in my experience, very fucking dumb	0
and then imagine half of them are dumber than that	0
what is the word for people who fight for what they want and see and seek to have more	0
i dont know even in portuguese now	0
i'm not sure i know what you are reffering to	0
but it is something americans are more than europeans	0
greedy?	0
greedy in  a positive way	0
ambicious	0
i think that is it	0
very ambicious 	0
i dont think americans are more ambitious than europeans	0
yeah the average person is	0
how do you figure that?	0
well i am actually just saying what i hear someone else say	0
but europeans live with their parents for longer	0
that is a fact	0
yes	0
because house prices	0
young people here open more companies too	0
just renting is so so expensive	0
and fail more	0
and we still graduate first, have kids first	0
so my feeling is that europeans are move settled down	0
populations in phase 3 tend to have kids later	0
while america is still being build	0
yes	0
it depends on where the population is, what stage it is	0
same with graduation	0
explaining why and how it happens is not argument against not being ambicious	0
it isnt even remotely have anything to do with ambition	0

okk	0
now i have some time to talk	0
i am in bed, needing to sleep though	0
i couldnt keep with the messages from the phone!	0
sorry	0
it was a very hectic day	0
handyc: still here or did you go to sleep?	0
some of my friends did shrooms, which was hilarious	0
i guess its enough talk of drugs for today	0

orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 11.173 seconds! You have made friends with 156 ducks in #romanian.	0
if i dont respond, it means i have fell asleep	0
hi orangeFlu 	0
sleep, hahaha	0
I am usually up until 2:00 am	0
it would be very unusual for me to sleep before 10:00 pm	0
wow you got shrooms	0
how did you get those	0
I have not had them in a long time	0
sounds like you are having a nice time here	0
I guess I just missed you by about 1 minute	0
that's okay, we will have plenty of time to talk later this week	0
i was watching a video	0
and right when i started it you came back haha	0
hey	0
oh okay	0
yeah, we got shrooms from a shop which bears a name i will never remember on my own	0
man, I'd love to know where to get those	0
I have not had them since I got married	0
but remind me to give it to you, it is on some conversation in my phone	0
yeah please	0
when you are here I can take a photo of your phone or something	0
I think those must be more tightly regulated	0
i'm not sure it was entirely legal	0
I have not ever heard Dutch people talk about those things	0
probably not but I don't mind if it's safe to buy them	0
i mean even from the place we got weed, they were very alert and asked for ID, told it would be ideal to pay cash, etc	0
yeah I always pay cash for weed	0
but they haven't ever ID'd me	0
how many people are you with?	0
what is the name from the place you get it? unless it is in den haag and not here, cause in that case the name wouldnt help me	0
probably it looked a little more weird with a whole group of guys going at once	0
8 more	0
my place is in Den Haag	0
it's just a 15 minute walk from my house	0
maybe it did, cause it isnt a very popular shop	0
there is a closer one, too, but I don't like their setup as much	0
I go to Happy Smile	0

eh, anyway, tomorrow we will probably visit stuff. Anne Frank, something about van Gogh	0
a lot of stuff	0
and i'm sorry, but i kinda need to sleep, handyc 	0
yes of course, go sleep	0
i am close to 48 hours without sleep	0
it's been a long day for you	0
yeah man	0
talk later	0
get some rest	0
take care	0
cool, talk tomorrow	0
glad you made it safely	0
night night	0
have fun and be careful	0
thank you	0

jesus fucking christ, this is dumb	0
cant be real	0
how was your day, orangeFlu ?	0
vagina shaped rocket!	0
100%	0
to fuck with bezo's 	0
damn	0
flying dick	0
haaaaaa	0
gasconheart: i went to a whorehouse, that should sum up my experience	0
oooh nice orangeFlu 	0
:P	0
not nice, no	0
you did??????????	0
i did not have a good time	0
you really did?	0
no joke?	0
because i paid 50 euros just for the girl to take me in the back, rub my dick for 1 minute, put a condom on it and tell me its gonna be 400 euros more for sex	0
no fucking way	0
i may be horny, but i have a brain	0
i said fuck no and left	0
holy shit	0
fuck that	0
its a quarter of my salary	0
the rent is not that expensive	0
thats ridiculous	0
how was she even like	0
she was probably going for: i will rub him for a bit, make him horny and he will says yes to any price i tell him	0
she was very nice about it all	0
very fucking hot	0
how did you find a worehouse so fast	0
:P	0
seriously its not been even one day	0
its exactly like the legends say, there is a whole street with girls in windows, like they are products, you choose which one you want and go with her in a room in the back	0
its very easy	0
hahahaaa	0
there is a street full of brothels	0
and you've been walking around the entire day?	0
no, me and my friends decided to go there to see what its like	0
we visited an erotic museum	0
and them walked around	0
ah i see	0
you are with friends	0
i saw her, liked her and said what the hell, nobody lives forever	0
a girl friend of mine lent me 50 euros cash, because i had it all on card	0
and that money went to nothing	0
my day is ruined	0
my friends were also curious how it would be like	0
when i walked out, they thought i finished in like 10 minutes	0
hahahha	0
hahahahaa	0
well good to know this thing is a scam	0
if it was me idk if i would able to say no	0
beyond that incident, everything was fine	0
i mean, it isnt nearly a scam more than is any marketing technique	0
they know how to make you pay	0
only problem is, i dont think they are required by law to put their prices up front	0
because nobody had them	0
you had to walk in and have your dick rubbed 	0
its pretty much a sacm	0
they tell the price when you are least likely to say no	0
how did you say no even???	0
it was a good dick rubbing though. wouldnt pay 50 for it, but it was nice	0
well, my brain switched off horniness instantly and realized i cant do that	0
even my friends were impressed	0
the need to save money is higher than the need to reproduce	0
thats amazing self control skills	0
thanks :))))))	0
Erotic museum?	0
nothing	0
you're too litle	0
there was no museum	0
read this log when you are 18	0
stop reading loudercake 	0

just dont tell me you want to play android games now :P	0
loudercake: do you want a new computer? i will let you play on mine for 50 euros, and then tell you its actually 500 for the whole thing	0
how would you feel	0
for 50 you get to turn it on	0
then for the user password 500	0
thats how i felt today	0
Broke	0

hahahha	0
no, we found one already	0
did you guys get super drunk and smash it up	0
no no	0
oh good	0
why would  you be kicked out of an hotel dude	0
we were coming back from the national msueum	0
rijksmuseum	0
hostel not hotel	0
oh you went there, cool	0
and they just said, there is an emergency and the ukrainian refugees are coming, and we need to vacate	0
so we did	0
oh shit	0
okay	0
oh nice	0
tell him the story orangeFlu 	0
I'm glad you didn't cause a problem	0
so we had a few hours to pack 	0
ive been holding not to tell	0
yes tell me	0
okk	0
I only saw that there was some adventure	0
so yesterday we went to the red light district	0
yes	0
of course	0
as you can imagine, i wanted to try pussy	0
yeah	0
well I think you've tried it before	0
so we went around he street, probing the free market to see which one i liked the most	0
yeah	0
handyc: well, yes, but i never paid for it	0
anyway	0
so many choices	0
right, I never paid either	0
we found one, my friends agreed this was the one	0
my wife just sent me an invoice, I think I have like 30 days	0
hahaha	0
nice, okay	0
and then in i go with her	0
and she asks for 50 euros	0
reasonable	0
i give it to her	0
thinking its cool	0
we go in the room, she puts a condom on ma dick	0
my penis	0
as one does	0
my ooh-lala	0
orange junior	0
and then she starts rubbing it to make it hard	0
as one does	0
and she talks about how i would like to do it	0
and she gives options, etc	0
at some point, she says: "depending on what you choose, the budget increases. what do you have in mind? 600-800 euros sound good?"	0
i am like wtf	0
no	0
what the fuck	0
no way!	0
it's supposed to be 60 euros for 20 minutes	0
what if we do it fast and easy, no blowjob, nothing, i last like 5 minutes anyway	0
wow what a scam	0
and she says that will be 350 euros because penetration	0
damn dude	0
I had no idea	0
i seriously take off the condom, throw it away and buckle my pants up	0
i tell her sorry	0
yeah of course	0
did you get your 50 back?	0
i cant eat anymore if i pay for this	0
no	0
that's fucked up man	0
sorry that happened to you	0
because i wasted a condom and she rubbed it	0
right	0
anyway	0
that's not worth 50 euros though	0
1/10 because she touched it	0
she should have at least given you back a 20	0
my friends were angry as well	0
mattf said  i have great self control	0
that sounds illegal	0
she, with the hand on my dick, telling me to pay more	0
he does indeed	0
and i said no	0
those things are supposed to be government regulated to prevent that kind of scam	0
i would fall for the trap	0
i thought so too	0
did you get any information on the girl, do you remember which booth it was?	0
maybe she realized you were new there and tried to scam you... idk	0
i do remember, yes	0
s/new there/stupid/	0
well, i mean, most people there were new i guess	0
wow you are really having an exciting trip	0
maybe she realized you were stupid and tried to scam you... idk	0
yes, it is a very good story so far	0
i mean, i dont get angry	0
i just think how fun it would be to tell this story one month from now	0
I want to hear more of this story, my son is in the bathtub right now, though	0
wow guys	0

it was nice to see you on thursday	0
mattf there was some delay, I saw a progress bar	0
yeah it was great to meet you finally	0
what did you think?	0
handyc: yeah godot builds a huge wasm thing, if this was just a js game like yours would be instantly	0
well but now we have the level maker and automatic builds, now it is up to loudercake to create the levels	0
i dont know why, but i knew you were short, but i still expected you to be taller	0
we are 3 days on out of 9	0
Ok	0
hmm	0
I guess in many ways what I expected	0
:join #gamedev	0
I am not sure what I expected	0
orangeFlu check out the new hanb	0

ok	0
am i tall?	0
orangeFlu everyone is tall to me except people in Hong Kong	0
my wife says she tricked you	0
those squishy balls in the hot pot that you enjoyed	0
were made from fish	0
ah, damn	0
i knew something was fishy	0
Btw mattf	0
I did not realize those were fishballs until she told me	0
loudercake: on gamedev	0
me neither, they didnt taste like fish at all	0
but i liked the bacon more anyway	0
that's why	0
she wanted to see if you could tell	0
what if i was allergic?	0
I asked you about allergies before we ate	0
handyc: I get 6000 minutes of build time for free per month. This game takes average 1 min to build	0
maybe i didnt know i was allergic	0
since i dont eat fish	0
yeah, I wish she would not have done it that way	0
I didn't know	0
mattf that means you can build the game 6000 times each month	0
well, the next day we went to the beach in den haag and ate there. i had vietnamese food, dutch food (bitterbalen) and american food all in one sitting	0
that means 8 times an hour mattf	0
oh nice	0
bitterballs are great	0
yeah, they were good	0
they are good with mustard and beer	0
funny thing is	0
we ate hot pot again the next day	0
i asked for beef	0
but	0
we still have meat left over	0
i couldnt taste any beef	0
where is the beef?	0
they are made from scraps of old meat	0
and the liquid inside?	0
different people put different amounts of meat	0
it's like a stew	0
it's like eating fried stew	0
it tasted a bit like fish, which turned me off really fast	0
it could have been better	0
i could make some at home	0
ok, now let's talk when you are coming to romania	0
because to be honest, i spend in 5 days in netherlands what i usually spend in 2 weeks in romania	0
its much much cheaper	0
oh nice	0
We will come to Romania	0
not now, its colder here than it was there	0
Yes it's expensive here	0
When is a good time to come, summer?	0
sure, but until july preferably	0
gasconheart and I also want to go to Brazil and see mattf and loudercake 	0
ohh	0
i would come as well, but i think that is well outside my budget	0
understood	0
i have to make some calculations	0
to see	0
we will have to plan it carefully too	0
we have never traveled with handyz before	0
we are planning to visit the USA in November	0
leave him at home, he is a smart guy	0
there is a conference there called AAR for religion	0
religious studies	0
no, my mom has to meet him	0
I am trying to get mattf to do this serious games conference in Bremen	0
anyway, the little guy is so so smart and gets what i am saying although i dont speak good clean english	0
he liked you	0
the cats also l liked you a lot	0
how do you know	0
that black cat especially	0
i smell like a black cat	0
because of how he was acting when you were here	0
he wanted to impress you	0
thats why he did whatever i told him to? haha	0
the black cat followed us halfway to the station, and she never does that kind of thing for anybody but me	0
yeah, I think he was amazed that you were so tall	0
the black one probably knew about you already through the secret network of black cats	0
black cats rely on some kind of transdimensional gateway to communicate with each other	0
my cat never leaves the house... i think it communicates through some signals from the windows	0
oh, that makes sense	0
yeah	0
damn, i wanted to experiment more with the kid	0
black cats are not like regular cats	0
i am kind of sad now	0
ha ha	0
well you can come back	0
or we meet up somewhere else	0
i wanted to see how he reacts when i give him instructions in romanian	0
do you want to do the serious games conference	0
it sounds much more imperative	0
I really want to do some of these	0
there is one in Bremen in 2022 November	0
i am not good at making games	0
then mattf can present a serious game and then meet his girlfriend	0
i have only ever made one	0
I want to make hanb into a real game	0
Lisa?	0
Tina	0
yes, Lisa, i know her	0

The first 3 levels need to have a tutorial box btw	0
you need to have a tutorial boxx	0
handyc: do some tests for me	0
tell him stuff in romanian	0
okay	0
with the necesarry body language	0
oh, I can!	0
yeah	0
and let's see how he reacts	0
he's already just getting the idea of 3 languages	0
i'm not sure you can use my voice and point to things yourself	0
you have to say those yourself	0
damn, it just hit me, the little guy will be able to communicate with more than half of the population of the earth in a few years time	0
maybe less	0
handyz inherited my psychic powers	0
I can communicate with him much more easily than my wife can	0
because english is a much easier language to understand	0
the black cat has the power also	0
the orange cat is a dumb dumb	0
sure, there is more grammar but not by much	0
but chinese has tones	0
yeah the tones	0
i would try to teach him esperanto as well	0
but that is just another kind of variable	0
damn, i would run so many experiments on my kid	0
all languages have some kind of varying thing	0
I don't see much value in learning esperanto	0
its awesome	0
if I were going to go that route I would teach Sanskrit	0
Sanskrit, Tibetan, classical Chinese, also Greek and Latin	0
if you know esperanto, its much easier to learn any other indo-european language than if you know dutch and english, which are just germanic, or say french, which is just romance, etc	0
You could make the same argument about Sanskrit though	0
it really pisses me off that it wasnt chosen as a lingua franca for europe	0
and then he could chant the Rig Veda	0
i have so many languages i want to learn, its unreal	0
let me see my mentions	0
mattf: 	0
mattf: 	0
mattf: 	0
mattf: 	0
We could make a Rig Veda video game and sell it to right wing Hindu nationalists	0
no thank you	0
It would be called Rigged	0
You get to play as any of 6 different kinds of religious ascetic	0
and you choose which austerities to do	0
handyc: yeah 3 hours per day	0
and then you acquire magic ascetic powers	0
can i choose how many atrocities i can commit?	0
like shooting light from your forehead	0
you can actually run any docker on this thing so you could even host a game... 3 hours per day or whtever	0
today i am feeling like genocide	0
that could be possible	0
here is how vedic power works,	0
you kill jews	0
celibate practices store sex energy	0
you can store that sex energy and then expel it in different ways, like through your third eye	0
like when Shiva burns down the entire universe	0
how many penises do i have in this game?	0
it's his ascetic sex retention power 	0
probably just one penis	0
12?	0
oh	0
but I have seen a couple multi-donged Shivas	0
yess	0
shrek had 12 penises	0
they are not very common	0
or, no, wait	0
the teletubbies, you know them?	0
they had 12 penises each	0
in Hindu mythology it's common to have multiple arms though	0
and also multiple heads sometimes	0
that i know	0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0N8WZMImCI	0
dont say i didnt warn you	0
its harry potter	0
handyc: you could use circle ci to scrape websites freely 	0
if you get 8 accounts you can have a free vps 24 hours per day	0
thank you mattf 	0
good idea	0
I am looking at it	0
how can I have 8 accounts though	0
you just need to create a docker for whatever you want to do	0
won't they know it's me?	0
no just have it from 8 emails or so	0
did you do it?	0
no, look at the video to see what i am talking about	0
no	0

very smol	0
but i am happy to be alive	0
he didnt eat me	0
im glad he forgot the chloroform	0
yes, me too	0
point is, he is a nice guy, i rate him 9/11	0
his kid was nice too	0
very smart, he could point to a banana in 3 languages	0
admittedly, he didnt say much, but he could understand my english no problem	0
and surprisingly he did everything i asked him to do	0
he would throw his toys on the ground for no reason, so i told him to pick them up, and he did!	0
handyc says it was because i was very tall and he didnt see people as tall as me before 	0
also, his wife is the sweetest of human beings	0
very wholesome family	0
ha ha ha	0
you did not see my wife's mean side	0
9/11 that's a terrorist rating	0
so you are rating me as a terrorist is what you are saying	0
I am glad you and my wife had a chance to talk while I was putting handyz to bed	0
i love rating things 9/11	0
if you were an arab, sure, that would have been a terrorist rating	0

English speakers are NASPAs in pronuncies when learning foreign languages; I usually do absolutely no effort at pronunciation 	0
hahahaaa	0

i dont think handyc was not puttin in effort	0
just that he sucked	0
because question is, what can we do about it?	0

 question is, what can we do about it?	0
i would like to do extensive sessions with him, and i want to torture him with romanian tongue twisters	0

he will be the master	0
handyc: gimme your skype	0
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight	0
wait	0
thats gae	0
for a girl that is not gae	0
i have no reason to believe mattf is not a girl	0
it must be easier to be a girl	0
the new white straight man is the black lesbian gril	0
grill	0
i know for certain it is not easier to a girl	0
grill is easier	0
yes	0
i meant grill from the start	0
its easier to have sex when you are a girl	0
yes, but the sex is usually bad when the guys dotn care about you enough to satisfy you	0
so whats the point	0
well thats another issue	0
if it was a man he would be already happy	0
well i think the thing is, life is easier for prettier people	0
but they are not, therefore easy to get sex is not something most girls want	0
oh, yeah, definitely	0
and girls are prettier in avergaeg	0
pretty/handsome people have it much much easier 	0
not necesarilly	0
they are	0
prettiness is relative	0
we just sexualize them more	0
yes	0
thats what makes them prettier	0
so some can take advantage of that	0
they are taking over	0
but on the other hand, the prettier you are, the more unwanted attention you get and chance of people sexually assaulting you or raping you goes up	0
for pretty guys thats not such an issue	0
i would like to be rapped by girls	0
like in animes	0
i dont think you do	0
like in animes hell yeah	0
:P	0
rape by definition is something you dont want	0
i dont know how it is depicted in anime	0
oh god	0
seems like we have definition guy here	0
is not actual rape by definition, just a plenty of horny girls	0
i would still call it rape because it is easier and shouldn't be that hard to get the idea	0
oh yeah, then it would be nice	0
its like the case of gascon saying there is a rule of "dont disrespect someone here" and handy c has a problem with that because "disrespect" is not well defined	0
its funny that in anime many girls are crazy horny male assaulting maniacs, but in west the female heroes now are muscular adventures that can do everything a man does and better	0

handyc: i was just talking to gasconheart about how it is to teach a child 3 languages at once and what are the possible advantages/disadvantages of teaching them a constructed language like esperanto, or on a very similar note, a language that he can only speak with the parents and no one else	0
the more i look at it, the clearer it seems that they reject any language that they don't have more than 2-3 persons to speak to, especially if those people the child is trying to access, also speak a language that many more people speak	0
say for example, mother speaks spanish and english and speaks only spanish with the kid. Father speaks german and english, but only speaks german with the kid	0
but between them, they speak english	0
now add that the whole mother's side of the family speaks spanish and they live in an english speaking zone	0
well, then, at some point they will start refusing speaking german	0
because they can use english with their father regardless	0
unless they have extensive german sources or people so that german is the only option, they will refuse german	0
its very interesting to me'	0
i suspect this is what will happen with cantonese from your wife	0
also makes me wonder how to fix it	0
also there was a story where the mother spoke in French, the dad in German, and the poor kid thought that men speak german while the women speak french. hahaha	0

Ukraine and Hungary are bigger, sorry, thats what i meant	0
yeah thats why they didn't show up then?	0
so if romania is selected, everything bigger than romania should not appear	0
they didn't show up right?	0
ukraine and Hungary shouldnt be there, while Moldova, Serbia and Bulgaria should	0
let me look again	0
yeah ukraine and hungary are not there	0

check out this shit	0
this is just insane	0

its like some of those weirdest porn plots but in real life	0

okay	0
I don't get it, why is that even a video	0
there are like 3 pictures	0

I can't understand the audio	0
gasconheart: have you ever seen the case of a pastor having sex with someone's of his cult wife because of a missinterpretation of the bible :P	0

so the husband was even agreeing with this	0
why would people take advice from a dumb old book anyway	0

sorry orangeFlu, I was indeed busy with handyz earlier	0
one comment I will say,	0
you said how can this be fized	0
fixed	0
I don't think the situation has to be seen that wat	0
way	0
there is not anything broken	0
he will surely grow up speaking Dutch with his peer group, that's just how it is	0
and he will put chocolate sprinkles on toast like a Dutch guy	0
he will never be Cantonese or American, that is okay	0
I lost all connection with my German roots also	0
You can't force culture on people that way, because their culture is their culture	0
yeah	0
there is always the chance he becomes a full fledged nerd with no friends too	0
I think he will have plenty of friend	0

he is a very sociable guy	0

re Cantonese	0
it's like being Jewish	0
Cantonese is its own thing	0
it's not like being Chinese	0
that is why the Hong Kong situation is so bad	0
Hong Kongers are their own thing	0
they are part of the Cantonese people	0
but Charlie will never be a Hong Kong guy or even a Cantonese guy	0
it is a shame in some ways but in others not	0
He will never be a China dumb dumb nationalist	0
He could be a Dutch dumb dumb nationalist but that is not very likel	0
likely	0
because there are something like 16 political parties here	0
There isn't really something called Dutch nationalism except for a few fringe groups	0
ok then, does your wife know mandarin?	0
i assume she does	0
Yeah	0
Most Chinese people know Mandarin because it's the state language	0
it's an artifical language created from the average of many northern dialects	0
artificial	0
but the grammar across most dialects is basically the same	0
subject verb object, like English	0
wo ai ni	0
I love you	0
i am not saying turn him into a nationalist.. but surely mandarin is a very useful language to know, so why wouldnt you teach him that considering he doesnt have to make much effort to learn it compared to if he wanted to learn it 10 years from now	0

I (ngo) able (sik) speak (gong) Cantonese language (gong dong hwa)	0
i got a question	0
the ngo is the sound we made,	0
the end of "fishing"	0
i know	0
yeah	0
this is why vietnamese has so many diacritics and accents everywhere? to express the many tones they probably have?	0
well, I also want to learn Mandarin, so we can study together	0
Vietnamese has something like 5 tones	0
yes, similar to Chinese,	0
but also they have a few consonant sounds that do not exist in most western languages	0
for example this bouncy sound they have, I call it bouncy d	0
it is like a d with the tongue way back in the throat	0
like saying "duuuuuh"	0
but as far as i can tell, only vowels have diacritics, so whatever way they use to mark those consonants, they apparently can make use of the latin alphabet ones	0
I think they write it as a d with a horizontal line through it	0
no, consonants also have them	0
for example in Sanskrit we have a sound like "sh" written as an 's' with an acute accent	0
s	0
ś	0
and this one with a dot under it	0
ṣ	0
it is also a "sh" sound at a different position in the palate	0
Ð	0
ð	0
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_with_stroke	0
Title: D with stroke - Wikipedia	0
looks like a voiced dental fricative	0
my understanding is it is not	0
from wiki: "Đ represents a voiced alveolar implosive (/ɗ/) or, according to Thompson (1959), a preglottalized voiced alveolar stop (/ʔd/)."	0
how many people still speak sanskrit natively?	0
but according to that page, also, the character is not considered to have a diacritic	0
the mark is part of the character	0
orangeFlu, "still", you already make too many assumptions	0
did anyone ever speak Sanskrit "natively"	0
no idea, i assumed at some point someone must have	0
some people do as an academic or religious exercise	0
but I do not think anyone ever bought bananas in Sanskrit	0
no, these kinds of assumptions lead down strange paths	0
Sanskrit is a language of power	0
it's used to subjugate people	0
then it absorbs their languages and claims that those were always a part of Sanskrit	0
yeah, but at some point, unless it was constructed, it must have been used to buy bananas or ask for dick	0
it started small	0
a group of people spoke it natively	0
right?	0
here is the best book about political subjugation with Sanskrit	0
https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520260030/the-language-of-the-gods-in-the-world-of-men	0
Title: The Language of the Gods in the World of Men by Sheldon Pollock - Paperback - University of Californ ... [trunc]	0
yes you have a point orangeFlu 	0
it's a contentious issue in academia	0
it's very much tied to aryan invasion theories, hindu nationalism, etc.	0
historically what we think happened is that there were various languages for buying bananas	0
in ancient Iran	0
so do i have your confirmation that at some point, somewhere, it is plausible that someone said "please give me that dick"	0
those cultures also gave rise to the Avestan language and the work called the Avesta,	0
the sacred text of Zoroastrianism	0
i just read about them	0
In Zoroastrianism, the gods (ahuras) drink the sacred haoma plant	0
In Vedic Hinduism, the gods (devas) fight with antigods (asuras) over the sacred soma plant	0
There are numerous parallels like this	0
so people must have bought bananas in some related dialect	0
i'm going to ask again, and be careful what you answer	0
so it is not right to say that people never bought bananas in Sanskrit	0
so do i have your confirmation that at some point, somewhere, it is plausible that someone said "please give me that dick"	0
but it was not proper Pāṇinian Sanskrit	0
like many languages, in Sanskrit "going" can be used as a euphemism for sex	0
I went with her	0
it doesnt have to be literally what i said	0
also in many languages, snakes and chickens are used as euphemisms for the penis	0
but someone asking for someone's dick (sex)	0
grab that snake	0
if i ever write a dissertation, i would end it exactly like this	0
also, here is one place you can look to answer your question, surely	0
there is a classic collection of erotic love poetry	0
that contains all the classic euphemisms	0
I read some of this for a class back in 2006	0

orangeFlu I just got back from the university	0
I met with one of my best students from the DH class	0
・゜ ​ ゜・。。・゜゜\_​0< QUAC​K!	0
he is trying to get into a PhD program for analyzing Korean texts digitally	0
.bef	0
orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 18.952 seconds! You have made friends with 162 ducks in #romanian.	0
yes	0
it is a new DH PhD program, the Korean thing is his own research idea	0
I told him that he should meet you at some point	0
like OCR?	0
Yeah OCR is involved	0
he is taking image scans of Korean book pages	0
from like 1920	0
i dont know why you think that, but i am not korean, what gave you that impression	0
no, because you know much more about the computer end	0
He teaches a Python course here but he is really just getting started	0
He is your age though	0
but he focused most of his energy on humanities stuff	0
He is a Dutch guy, white guy	0
He studies Korean language and just completed a BA	0
Now he wants to take that data and do something more digital with it	0
He takes these page images,	0
and he trains a neural network on them	0
then he uses that to try and figure out which actual book printer created that book	0
so that he can make a social network graph of early Korean print technologies	0
oh, so he doesnt want to transcribe them, thats what i've been getting	0
hmmm	0
I am trying to get him on IRC but I think that's a bit new to him	0
No not to transcribe	0
i'm sure there are better ways to do that than a neural net	0
the image data are used for determining the book printer	0
yes.....	0
but he doesn't necessarily have to understand the characters	0
thank you for saying it the second time	0
or even get the characters correct	0
but my point still stands	0
i'm sure there are better ways to do that than a neural net	0
well that's why I thought you and he should meet	0
then he can explain it to you directly	0
i dont know when i can be back in the netherlands	0
Yeah but we all have Skype	0
and you will be in Denmark soon	0
i wanted to come again in june when i am staying in germany, because i am only some hours on the train away	0
but i will be strapped for cash	0
You can come anytime	0
You are always welcome	0
and you can stay here instead of a hotel	0
i hope i will be in denmark...	0
But my point is we could meet up now online and begin working out ideas informally	0
it would not have to be any kind of required meeting, just to share ideas	0
I thought if I could get him on here then we could all talk about it at various times	0
but if too many academics come here we might accidentally start talking philosophy and loudercake would be mad	0
well, my feeling is, since i myself dont know the domain of image analysis that well, is that there are better ways to do it. he could try anything from extracting some parameters from an edge map of the image to more complicated stuff that i really dont master right now	0
neural nets are a sure thing to make you frustrated in the process	0
and a few months in you realize it isnt as simple as you thought	0
and just "adding more neurons" isnt going to cut it	0
you say he is just starting in computer stuff, and he went directly to neural nets and DL, a domain known for its very very dense maths involved, unpredictability and high computing power demand	0
this is what i have to say about this	0
sure, it sounds good, and if you are good at ML, it may be able to work beautifully, but he is not	0
・゜゜・。。・ ​ ゜゜\_ø<​ Q​UACK!	0
how is he going to account for pages that dont correspond to any printer? false positives? false negatives? how many pages does he have?	0
.bef	0
orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 7.984 seconds! You have made friends with 163 ducks in #romanian.	0
he needs training data, testing data, validating data. I am sure he may learn what those are and how to make them work to some degree	0
but my fear is	0
he chose ML because thats what everybody uses right now and its still flashy and awesome, but the truth is, 90% of things people use ML for today, can be done with more "traditional" approaches	0
and ML is totally overkill	0
are you still here or am i talking alone?	0
hey	0
sorry	0
I went out to the garden for a minute	0
orangeFlu 	0
yes	0
I did not suggest the neural nets to him	0
my black cat missed me	0
he took my class	0
good, that's a good cat	0
when he took my class his project was to create a Django interface for the neural network data	0
now she stays with me everynight when i go to sleep and she watches youtube with me	0
so he could query it by dropping an image right into a Django app	0
i put my head on the pillow, staying on my tummy, with the phone propted up on the wall	0
the neural network is not very successful yet on things it hasn't seen before	0
yes I think he did choose ML for those reasons, it's popular	0
and she stays between me and the phone, sleeping exactly like me	0
but on her side	0
but if it gets him funding that is fine, then he can switch to any method that proves to be reliable	0
watching the phone	0
funding for what?	0
my cat likes to sleep in the space between my knees	0
funding for being in a PhD program	0
nah, she sleeps at my head, right next to me, because she got used to sleeping between me and my gf when we were together	0
if we have enough of these projects going we can live off the grant money	0
I had a head sleeping cat when I was a kid	0
I have befriended about 7 cats	0
training data is a large collection of Korean books, he knows how to obtain these from his own custom scraping scripts	0
testing and validating I am not sure because I do not know Korean language	0
well, if he needs funding, sure, go with ML	0
well he is looking to get into a program and I think it comes with funding or something	0
well, usually, when you start with a supervised net, you have labeled data to train your net, obviously	0
things like	0
page 1, this was printed by XXX	0
page 2, printed by YYY	0
My point is that long term it is nice to have people with different kinds of domain knowledge interested in similar things	0
and so on	0
you have to know how to divide that data into training and validation data	0
and testing, sorry	0
yeah, he does have, to some degree	0
He has a scraping script that can get an unlimited quantity of image scans	0
As for labeling, I do not know	0
validation is data that is usually labeled, but you give it to the net unlabeled, and see if it guesses it right. From that, you get an accuracy reading and you know how far off it is from 100% accuracy	0
I think there must be some manual component to it that limits the amount that one human can do in a finite amount of time	0
what is the difference between testing and validation?	0
but maybe the computer could also train itself at some point	0
good question	0
what is the difference between testing and validation?	0
good question	0
you are asking me?	0
of course not	0
i am putting the text again because i am sure you were not paying attention	0
How can you be sure	0
because it happened to me before with you	0
If you were so sure, why not put it only the second time and not the first time	0
because the second time may grab your attention	0
and then you would pay attention	0
which it did	0
Yes	0
so if that was the point, only put it the second time and not the first	0
i will answer your self teaching computer problem	0
but	0
It is like those buy one get one free ice cream deals	0
what is the difference between testing and validation?	0
You go and you get your two ice creams	0
then say I only wanted the free one	0
get a refund	0
testing data is also part of the training data. Your net may be in a situation where it exactly learnt "by heart" the training data you gave it	0
What is called learning	0
the same way a kid may not know how to solve some equations, but memorized them and gives you the right answer anyway	0
its called overfitting	0
Yeah	0
in that case, your accuracy would come to about 100%	0
but of course, it is misleading	0
Yeah that is his problem right now	0
so you use testing data for accuracy reading during training	0
He gets very high accuracy on the texts he trained but only 50% accuracy on unknown texts	0
yes	0
so you need some validation texts that it wasnt trained on	0
that is the real accuracy	0
yeah	0
and you need to make sure you dont back propragate from them	0
in other words	0
you should only use them for validation, but dont modify the parameters of the net from the accuracy reading	0
otherwise they just became testing data as well	0
the results of the validation phase should be only for your eyes	0
yeah, to me these are details	0
the net should not learn from them	0
if he presents the proposal well, then he can improve the structure of the network until it does what he wants	0
and then write some other things based on interpretations of the data	0
if you do indeed get high accuracy from testing, and low for validation, it means it overfit, and the network is too complicated	0
he needs to simplify it	0
well, his situation computationally is that he has access to that same ALICE cluster that I was working on	0
it's an enormous computer	0
if he has access, good for him	0
he could certainly make very complicated networks on them	0
but tell him what i said	0
yes I made sure to get him access before I left	0
i have a friend who is very very good on these things, everything i know is from him	0
nice	0
I want to know more about them too	0
network is too complicated if he got the results you described. tell him to search for overfitting and look up solutions. Also, idk how much he knows, but tell him to look over convolutional layers and different activation functions. Things like Relu. First and last layers should never be convolutional though, haha :))	0
handyc: its a very dense field with maths so complicated, i cant comprehend it	0
well here is my view	0
humans live a finite amount of time	0
i have given up because i realized i am not that interested to stay 8 hours a day to understand a single math formula	0
it's not possible to learn everything	0
but there are certain things I will always be interested in	0
even if I know I can't get to the end of the field, it makes sense to dip in	0
you can dip in, like i did, but dont expect to get too far	0
well that's also why I try to design small things like hanb	0
I like to make very small projects	0
it gets really complicated once you want to do anything besides "guess what number this is"	0
not to talk about reznets and reinforcement learning	0
think of it this way,	0
thats shit my friend spent two years to understand	0
any time you get to something in a field you don't understand,	0
that's a black box	0
you can outsource that black box to a friend who knows that domain	0
if you can befriend people in enough domains you can outsource any question you have about reality	0
you just have to build a network of the black boxes to connect those friend	0
friends	0
i will think of it any other way, i know the basics, i know its not for me, but i will happily read other people's achievements in the field and live vicariously through them	0
my skill is connecting people socially who work in very different domains	0
I will probably never be an expert in either of Asian Studies or Computer Science 	0

i am still alive, but very very busy	0
I understand	0
gasconheart I can have orangeFlu on anytime he wants to be on	0
anytime, my man	0
so orangeFlu can ask me, in English, what he asked me in Romanian the other day about esperanto	0

draq: handyc is doing an audio show later today	0
there's nothing fixed about my show	0

it is a show that is perpetually broken by design	0
which is OK	0
no pressure orangeFlu, gasconheart 	0
it's not a class	0

I don't like to abuse my authority when I teach people	0
I find that I get better students this way	0
we can do a skype test to see if everything is alright	0
one of my students is trying to get into a PhD program	0
I told him to talk to orangeFlu so that he can figure out how to do neural networks properly	0
handyc: skype test	0
i am free to do show today	0
OK!	0
also, i have thicccc russian accent	0
I will hook up a third mic!	0

oops	0
sec	0
no sex today	0
after the show if there is still time	0
ooooh	0
i can hear you alright	0
but you cant hear me	0

it's because I set Skype to output to a virtual soundcard	0

that was the best way to route Skype to anonradio	0

nice, thank you	0
i read and seems this 4 cpu 24gb ram is really always free 	0
but arm cpu	0
that's incredible	0
oh, okay	0
well I don't mind arm	0
it will still run my python code just fine	0

I don't use any fancy libraries	0

okay	0
thanks	0
this thing isn't available anywhere	0
got it	0
anymore	0
oh okay	0
you can use ubuntu btw	0
the guy on the video uses this oracle linux	0
saying the rest wouldn't work with arm or so	0
but i think it all works, at least ubuntu is now	0
this is like an extremely beefy pi	0
mattf	0
is there any reason I should not choose amsterdam	0
idk, maybe the 24 ram one isn't available	0
make sure you can change that later 	0
might be written there	0
you need to confirm with a CC	0
your phone number and, CC and personal address must be all in the same country	0
it says once I assign a home region I can't change it	0
oh damn, I don't want to give them credit card details	0
I did this with Amazon AWS once before and they started billing me	0
well they say always free	0
and people on that video comments seem all happy	0
they also have paid things there	0
oh	0
i have a bank that lets me do virtual CC's handyc	0
im about to delete the CC i used there	0
thanks for reminding	0
this is awesome anyway	0
once again a web service that can't fathom the concept of someone living in one country and having a credit card from another	0
I have no credit card in the country in which I live	0
and now it won't let me proceed, it's stuck	0
it won't let me change my country	0

I went back to the page where I initially made the account	0
the vps is real though	0
and changed the country to USA	0
yes I believe you	0
it's just that the interface sucks	0
your game is so hard sometimes	0
yeah	0
leave it to the Dutch to create an absolutely awful web experience	0
orangeFlu the clue?	0
geography mode?	0
when there are 5 countries, it takes me 15-20 connections to make it work	0
and then i get a round with 8 countries?	0
that's the reward I get for using my real email	0
no, fuck that	0
so now I guess I will use a fake email and a fake credit card	0
thanks oracle, suck a wet fart out of my asshole	0

orangeFlu: china, russia, those are impossible	0
central african republic and 3 more other countries are also fucked	0

sorry, I am just practicing my Dutch racism	0
by my countries standards, i am in the top 0.5%	0
something like that	0
it took me an embarrassingly long time to find estonia	0
i know	0
the baltic countries and the balkan countries are the worst	0
slovakia vs slovenia vs croatia vs bosnia vs czech, impossible	0
yeah	0
i messed them up myself	0
I also get the terms Balkan and Baltic confused	0
be careful with that cyprus	0
I think I am probably better than most Americans at it but that's not saying much	0
Baltic are 3: Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - from south to north	0

just 40%? look at the american education system hard at work	0

how much did you get at the quiz?	0

have you heard about the competition for the quarter pounder, orangeFlu 	0
yes	0
of course	0
mcdonald's came out with the quarter pounder	0
classical american story	0
and then I think Burger King came out with one that was 1/3 pound	0
and nobody wanted to buy it because they thought it wasn't a good deal	0
but they thought it was less than 1/4	0
yes	0
very based, i love that	0
I don't understand this word 'based'	0
I don't understand any slang that developed after 1997	0
i will not explain it, my zoomie brain doesnt know how to	0
oh yeah you are a zoomer	0
no you're not	0
not really, i dont think	0
are you	0
but i like how zoomie sounds	0
I think handyz is some other thing,	0
not a millenial either, technically	0
the generation that does not yet have a fixed name	0
I'm a late Gen Xer	0
one of the last	0
yeah, but the z i like to think comes from zoomie	0
well Y is millenials because they came after Gen X	0
and Z comes after Y	0
the zoomers are the children of the X-ers	0
so he is a zoomie technically	0
do i refer to him as "he, him"?	0
no I just mean in general	0
is that the correct pronoun?	0
we're not pushing gender roles on him yet, orangeFlu, I think it's a bit early for that	0
we will wait until he is 18 and then he can decide	0
hahaha	0
yes it's he	0
i will refer to him as "hee, heem" or "xe, xim"	0
zarm	0
or it	0
it is a he	0
my pronouns are "my" and "mine"	0
well you met him	0
couldn't you tell?	0
MJ's are "hee, hee"	0
hahaha	0
I am not sure how places like Pew define generations exactly,	0
it was very cute, yes, but it doesnt talk much, i cant wait for it to talk	0
but I think they generally go by a period of about 15 or 20 years and link it to significant events	0
yes	0
Boomers are easy, post-WWII birth rates	0
and X is just anybody after Boomers	0
but we call everyone boomers these days	0
with a cutoff around 1981	0
everyone over 40	0
I don't	0
i do	0
I don't understand why people do that	0
it's like how people misuse the term "third world"	0
it's stupid	0
because my parents behave like boomers, they have the same mentality	0
My parents are boomers	0

now she is mad at me for asking her to please wait until the end of the show	0
i would be too	0
I think if I inject that foam insulation it will work fine	0
but the bigger problem is that she would probably just knock on the studio door until I answer	0
she just told me, "It's not important, it's just some joke show anyway"	0
tell her its important to me	0
I did	0
I said exactly that	0
hahaha	0
nice	0
and she said, "Bullshit, I don't care"	0
i respect her so so much after this line, but still not cool	0
I don't think it's very respectable at all	0
it's rude as fuck	0
I use this show to try and prepare my voice for professional voice projects	0
and also to train her not to interrupt me when I do those	0
i dont care that much, and i dont think it makes sense to get angry over it	0
by, kenny	0
because she also walks in when I am working on actual projects for clients	0
no, it's rude	0
it doesn't matter what the content of the show is,	0
if you tell someone, "please don't interrupt me while I am doing a live radio show," and they intentionally come in two minutes before the live show ends	0
it's really disrespectful	0
It's the reason I can't do a serious show	0
because I never know for sure if she will even allow me to do the show	0
fuck, i dont know, be more stern?	0
a few times I had to cancel things I had planned to do during the show and do an automated playlist because she demanded I go and watch the baby	0
it doesn't work, orangeFlu 	0
she's nuts	0
i'm not good with the marriage stuff and my emotional intelligence is that of limestone	0
if I get angry at her, she says I'm being irrational	0
if she gets angry at me, she says I made her angry	0
there's no way to logic out of this	0
ha, okay	0
well I am just venting anyway, that pissed me off	0
so you want me to listen? not provide solutions?	0
either	0
I am not sure what I want	0
I just want her to stop interrupting the fucking show	0
It's not just this show	0
She does it when I am on professional calls with other academics	0
ok this kasm is the most useless thing i could install	0
And also when I am attending virtual conferences	0
conferences for which I am the organizer	0
and sometimes the presenter	0
A few times she brought our son into the room when I was in the middle of a job interview	0
from my pov, it sounds kinda manipulative... and i dont use that word lightly, i've been through two relationship where exactly this happened to me. Of course, i dont know her side of the story.. but this is what it sounds like to me	0
It's one of the reasons I bombed a bunch of programming interviews	0
She is manipulative	0
She has many good qualities as well	0
But this is one of her worst qualities	0
I was wrapping up a call with these sysadmins in Canada when my research partner and I were requesting a slice of their supercomputing cluster	0
and she brought the baby in the room and told him to go walk right up to me	0
just like absolutely no sense of the importance of the call or the effect that would have	0
It ended up distracting me so much that I forgot to clarify the amount of RAM we would get on our VPS	0
oh man	0
4 cpu cores, 24 gb of ram	0
more than that is not always free	0
that's what I would expect	0
i still think we should have a show about programming languages and draw parallels	0
yes, it's a great idea	0
want to do it next week?	0
we could have mattf on also	0
sure	0
but i dont think mattf wants to	0
mattf: what do you think, buddy?	0
oh my im just a stupid dude, you wouldn't want to talk with me	0
i do	0
great picture, mattf, thanks for sharing it with me	0
np	0
i could turn ken into a talking bot	0
mattf: That would be cool 	0
in one hour the football game begins	0
ah maybe i could run a larynx api on the new vps and make ken send audios	0
mattf: Do you want to have some fun 	0
ok does someone have a project that is not useless	0

I was putting my son to bed	0
shit i didnt even realize	0
now I'm ready to jam	0
handyc: bitch, ive lived	0
orangeflu	0
youre not dead	0
orangeFlu did you finally pop your cherry	0
no, but i am depressed now	0
oh sorry	0
what's going on with you?	0
pop my cherry regarding?	0
we're doing the godot game jam	0
orangeFlu: let this chat entertain you, and cheer you up	0
theme is fragile	0
pop your cherry re: last time you were here you tried to get sex and failed	0
good evening, handyc 	0
good evening, loudercake 	0
hi gasconheart 	0
yeah loudercake 	0
good evening guys	0
and mattf is off somehow	0
I am trying to come up with something creative	0
me too	0
eggs are fragile	0
but I bet a lot of people do Easter egg projects	0
handyc: i've had a rough couple of weeks and i fell into some dark place. also, what do you mean, i tried to have sex? :))	0
I need to think about fragility in a different way	0
orangeFlu did you or did you not attempt to purchase sex services last time you were in the Netherlands	0
i guess something to do with balance	0
orangeFlu, I understand dark places, be careful	0
maybe a platformer where the player has to rapidly switch both sides so the level doesnt fall	0
it's good to travel with friends	0
handyc: oooh, you mean that, but it wasnt for cherry popping purposes, it was for fun and for me to spend all my hard earned money	0
that sounds like a good idea but i have no idea where to start with 	0
fragility does not need to be physical fragility, either	0
why must my good ideas be so hard to code?!	0
my cherry has been popped by a less than lucky girl some years ago, thank you very much	0
yeah I know, orangeFlu, I am just teasing you	0
men can't be virgins anyway, by definition	0
loudercake: in my experience, i had good ideas when i didnt know how to code properly, and when i learned, i didnt have good ideas anymore.. so count your blessings	0
here is my hot take on it	0
ideas often seem more complex than they are	0
thats also true	0
ideas that seem complex often seem like better ideas than they are	0
you realise what ideas are feasible 	0
try to simplify your ideas	0
the best ideas are even better when they come across in a simple way	0
and you start to discard most of them as you learn more	0
if an idea can hold up to simplification then it's more likely to be a good one	0
muse be the dunning kruger	0
if you have to obfuscate your good idea then it's probably not a good idea	0
loudercake I am going for the cards first	0
if I can fit all those cards in, then the rest of the game should fall into place	0
thats not how it works	0
why not?	0
the cards are communit sourced	0
so is theme	0
I don't know what you mean	0
programming a blackjack game?	0
I am telling you that I am focusing on the 3 cards first	0
hey i know	0
okay	0
maybe snake but	0
then I don't know what you mean by, "that's not how it works"	0
the playboard rapidly decayse	0
it means thats not how the game works	0
but I am designing the game	0
i meant	0
the theme and the cards arent necessarly in sync	0
the three cards are three extra things that you can add to the game	0
I am focusing on adding the three cards first	0
handyc: did you make any updates regarding hanb?	0
yes orangeFlu a few, but not all of them went on the page	0
I am focusing on my new game jam game for the next 9 days	0
well i have lenty of time since im on my school break	0
the game has to be written in godot	0
and the theme is "fragile"	0
the extras are: "no health bar", "enemy music intensifies with gameplay' and 'playable menu'	0
so I will focus on those three things first	0
and then write the rest of the game around those things	0
that is what I mean when I say that I will focus on the 3 cards first	0
and then the rest of the game should fall into place	0
im gonna make a snake game	0
I was thinking about fragility in the sense of emotional fragility	0
well you can make a heartfelt game	0
if youre artsy enough	0
hi	0
I'm artsy	0
mattf: hello, beautiful bitch	0
mattf: my feral boy, how are you	0
the art will not be the difficult part	0
wow orangeFlu, 5 years later	0
loudercake: art wont be a problem, you should have seen handyc's soundproof booth for the show, it's nothing if not artistic	0
mattf: eeeh, 5 years	0
ha ha thanks orangeFlu 	0
yay im an op now	0
\o;	0
soon to be somewhat functional once I begin filling with foam	0
\o/	0
YAY!	0
why do that gasconheart 	0
it is customary in the Romanian IRC servers to reward loyal visitors with a non-permanent op	0
it sounds pretty good asis from what i heard yesterday handyc	0
ok	0
idk mattf; because they are nice people? I guess	0
:)	0
have to pop out for a little while, back in about 40 min	0
ok	0
thanks loudercake but you did not hear it when my son was screaming	0
it's not very soundproof yet	0
i didnt hear the whole thing	0
hey, Romanians: so you have any explanation or theory as to why there is such a cult around the @ in the Romanian IRC communities? BlackBishop, aZaZeL? any ideas?	0
lmfao i bet that was awesome	0
i shoulve stuck around	0
*do	0
gasconheart: IT stuff is "magic" for some	0
and seeing people with power is even more magical	0
I see	0
what type of cult you talking about gasconheart  ?	0
10 ECHO poop 20 goto 10	0
*magic*	0
however, it is a cultural thing at this point; also traditional; users at Romanian IRC servers *learn* to love the @	0
mattf can we talk on #gamedev	0
 te referi la administratori ?	0
n`am prins`o	0
aZaZeL: a "cult" or at least an overrated admiration for being op (@)	0

BlackBishop: weren't you a gentoo user?	0

why are you talking like that	0

no no	0
it was România even then	0
when they switched to spelling with î only, they kept România intact	0
that's right	0
right, "Romînia" was before Ceasca	0
loudercake I have a golden idea	0
spit it out	0
you work for a game dev company making and testing user interfaces	0
each level of the game is a broken interface	0
you have to figure out how to hit things in a certain order to make it break or not break in a certain way for playtesting	0
that also solves the riddle of how to make the menu playable, it will just be another interface	0
that sounds tough	0
so each level will have certain things you have to do in a certain order, like hit the yellow button three times, moves the mouse to the upper right corner and then hit the spacebar	0
and im not good at making levels for puzzle games	0
this is really funny to me because i am thinking of a QA coming home from work and thinking "do you know what i want to play? that game about breaking interfaces"	0
and you have to either replicate user submitted bugs or mark them as cleared	0
what do you think, orangeFlu 	0
truckers play truck simulator	0
I think people would really dig this	0
i think i've seen a game like this before	0
yes there are some	0
there are some games where you have to repair code and stuff	0
so it's not entirely original	0

handyc you befriended a duck in 3.751 seconds! You have made friends with 319 ducks in #romanian.	0
if it makes da money	0
why not	0
man this is going to be great though	0
I already have some levels planned	0
so your boss will give you a project and say something like, 'This lady's flower website crashes if you click any of the blue buttons'	0
and then the boss level could be a meeting with the actual boss	0
then each level can also become a mini game of its own if I have time	0
that sounds so freaking tough for a 9day game jam	0
why?	0
like	0
all I need to do is make some plausibly broken interfaces	0
coming up interfaces for each level	0
yes	0
seems straightforward to me	0
i couldnt even manage coming up with stuff for cluennector	0
but I think I approach these problems in a different way from you	0
I have another game idea	0
you try to pick up girls by collecting flowers	0
each girl likes a particular kind of flower	0
she will cry if you get her the wrong kind or the wrong number of flowers	0
or if you wear the wrong clothing	0
or if you say or do not say the correct thing	0
that's the healthbar, but she won't tell you how you're doing	0
im gonna make something more simple	0
you can only infer it from her body language	0
the snake game but the level slowly decays	0
handyc: is this based on your wife by any chance?	0
ha ha	0
well all of my stories are from personal experience	0
they say you should write what you know	0
he's my third idea	0
is the ui idea also from personal experience	0
very specific with "she will cry if you get her the wrong kind or the wrong number of flowers"	0
it's an ascetic trying to gain powers through meditation	0
but if he gets angry or horny he loses his power	0
how does he get horny?	0
orangeFlu there is a special level where you use the wrong rag to wipe the wrong dish	0
does the player make him horny?	0
the fuck is an ascetic	0
orangeFlu he gets horny when he sees a woman	0
an ascetic is someone who practices bodily mortifications for religious advancement	0
like when Christ fasted for 40 days	0
in the game you are supposed to touch his pp and if you do it fast enough, he gets horny. best played with a joystick	0
well there is plenty of Indian literature to draw from, orangeFlu 	0
hhahahah, joystick is literally a dick	0
this is a common theme in Indian stories,	0
ascetic meditates, then he sees a beautiful woman and blows his load	0
which is? joysticks?	0
i see	0
the spiritual power of tapas is directly connected to sexual suppression	0
semen is raw energy in the Indian mythos,	0
i would love to blow my load while doing spiritual advancement, it means someone finds me sexually attractive	0
semen retention leads to spiritual powers like mind reading, bodily powers like being able to levitate, etc.	0
in egyptian mythology, it's poison	0
oh, yes, i did no nut november, i know all that	0
this is how Shiva is able to shoot beams of energy from his forehead	0
it's because he spends all his time meditating in a cremation ground and not having sex	0
that's why he is usually depicted with a huge boner	0
he is blue or gray from smearing his body with cremation ash	0
orangeFlu I haven't seen a gaming joystick in like 20 years	0
it used to be that everyone bought one	0
I don't even know anybody with a joystick now	0
how did people go from "lets have orgies and fuck whenever" to "not having sex is a virtue and makes you shoot lasers from your forehead. by the way, what the fuck is a laser"	0
analogs are the new joysticks	0
handyc: i see a joystick everytime i get home	0
it seems to me that a lot of the creativity went out of the peripherals industry when things switched entirely to USB/digital from the old style analog ports, which were very easy to hack around with	0
not really, no	0
i call bullshit	0
well i like playing on a controller thats not a freaking rectangle	0
he doesn't shoot lasers, he shoots energy	0
what is laser? not energy?	0
the connection between sex and energy seems in some ways obvious	0
in ancient Indian there was no knowledge of lasers, there was some knowledge about energy	0
*India	0
but WHY would they think that? why abstain from sex specifically and think, well, that energy gets accumulated and i will be able to disperse it through my forehead? It's true, it is one of the feelings that keeps accumulating, but from that to shooting lasers...	0
pew pew	0
in ancient Indian there was no knowledge of lasers -- i know, that's why my characters also asks "what the fuck is a laser"	0
well, it's difficult to distill a thousand years of philosophical/religious development into a few sentences,	0
but here is the basic idea,	0
in Indian mythology, there is a lot of emphasis on the idea of thing originating in breath, heat and desire	0
*things	0
reality itself came into being because it wanted to be here, and it breathed	0
and in breathing it became a hot thing that had thoughts	0
so that is the kind of literary ground	0
there is a persistent idea that reality is made of desires	0
and because it has thoughts, it also has sexual desire?	0
sex is the strongest desire,	0
s/(?<=I ha)\w+(?=.*gol.*)/d/;s/idea/shower/	0
leaving the world system is a major goal in many Indian religions,	0
:(	0
so sex being the thing that holds you back seems like a pretty logical connection	0
i would say food is the strongest desire, but they probably had that covered when they settled and went from hunters and gatherers to an agriculture system	0
I don't think so	0
if you look at animals,	0
many of them will do all kinds of things that go against self preservations,	0
s/(?<=I ha)\w+(.*gol.*)/d\1/;s/idea/shower/	0
preservation	0
yes, some prefer sex over food	0
including starving to death,	0
yeah	0
some	0
but does any organism prefer food to sex	0
I do not think evolution would allow for it in the long term	0
sex has to be the strongest desire to keep the system going	0
because it's such a risky thing to do	0
s/(?<=ke I ha)\w+(.*gol.*)/d\1/	0
if sex weren't something we desired irrationally, it would be difficult to convince someone to do it, it's very weird and dangerous,	0
it exposes the organism to foreign fluids and also forces the organism to let its guard down	0
very easy to get killed having sex	0
well, sex is useless without food to gestate/grow the children, because the act of conceiving consumes a lot of energy, so you would think that would be covered first, and when that is satisfied, sex commences	0
so there has to be a very strong irrational desire to do it	0
oh the history limit damn	0
 	0
there is always food, though	0
loudercake I have a golden idea	0
s/(?<=I ha)\w+(?=.*gol.*)/d/;s/idea/shower/	0
loudercake I had a golden shower	0
worst case scenario, even children or parents can serve as food	0
yes my regex was right!	0

oh thats why they are named black widows	0
I don't know how many	0
yes loudercake 	0
ok, consider me convinced, apparently many is correct	0
well think of it this way, there are a lot more bugs than anything else	0
so if some behavior like that is observed in at least one	0
god scientistist dont even know the cause lol	0
then it is likely to be in a thousand others	0
for example, i dont like to consume my mate's head	0
and she never ate mine, evidently	0
well I have never tried it	0
it could be something beneficial to the relationship	0
me neither but i THINK it is illegal in some states	0
even with consent?	0
that's in interesting question	0
*an	0
did you know? 51 states in the US forbid eating your mate's head even with consent	0
literally 1984	0
there have been a few cases of people who consented to having limbs removed and eaten	0
i think some cannibalism is legal in the US with consent	0
yes	0
there was a case some years ago of someone who wanted his penis to be cooked and eaten	0
and I think he wanted to be murdered also	0
there are cannibalic restaurants	0
I can't remember the details	0
weird business opportunity, i dont think people would invest in it at Shark Tank, but i've been surprised before	0
well weird business ideas are often good ideas	0
but they can also be risky	0
there is a fine line between being creative and being too bizarre to be successful	0
let me put it this way? would you like if a woman put her feet in your milk&cereal? 	0
wait, dont answer that...	0
when things like meat cloning are easier to do, people will probably pay money to eat clones steaks made from celebrities	0
*cloned	0
i dont need to know the answer	0
feet don't really do it for me	0
so no, please leave my cereal footless	0
i dont know, man, people seem to love it	0
some do, that is okay with me	0
some people watch videos of women farting on balloons	0
even chinese people had a thing for weird, small, disfigured feet	0
yeah, foot binding is bizarre	0
I am glad they don't really do that anymore	0
i see the appeal with feet, but it doesnt do it for me either	0
i just understand if you like it	0
sexual maps are mostly formed in childhood	0
people latch onto all kinds of things	0
i wonder why there arent any women with foot fetish for men feet	0
this was always interesting to me	0
i mean, there probably are	0
but much lower percentage	0
I think generally men tend to have more fetishes than women anyway	0
foot fetish is fairly common for men, but the other way around is rare	0
i dont know about that	0
i've seen some study at some point claiming its fairly constant	0
analyzing even the type of fetish	0
into categories	0
it was really interesting	0
oh, I could be completely wrong, then	0
never have i ever been so horny reading a scientific paper 	0
many of these things are very difficult to study because of observer bias problems	0

anyway better keep the same ide	0
this thing has such a low time	0
yeah mattf	0

it is a kind of meta-game	0
it might not be a winning entry but I have this thing I want to try	0

handyc: any ideas for a 3D irc client	0
oh really	0
oh you can play any sf2 with that	0
well you could use avatars that float in a 3d space	0
yeah that project is nice, I am going to try using it for adding midi music to my game	0
dynamic music generation	0
then I will just play my keyboard for a few hours and generate all the game music at once	0
yes also dymamic is possible	0
dynamic	0
why you need midi in a game	0
if not for making it dynamic or a musical game	0
because I want music	0
if you are going to record something on a real instrument then you can just record a wav	0
or mp3	0
midi files are way smaller	0
you could have 30 hours of midi and it would be small	0
you could make a game where each land in the kingdom has a different midi file for 24 hours	0
that is why midi is so great, it's like text files for audio	0
ok make a 30 hour long game for the jam	0
yeah I could	0
with all autogenerated content	0
yeah	0
could be an endless game	0
but with me actually jamming on the keyboard for 30 hours	0
yeah	0
and then when you play the game it rings my phone and I play for you live	0
over a special keyboard to app connection	0
hahaha	0
but sometimes I am in the bathroom and then it will play audio of me in the bathroom	0
that would be hilarious	0

here is what I want to do mattf	0
the last awk command is doing nothing	0
I want to sort this list of png files by color	0
i see	0
and send them to 64 different directories based on rgb values	0
so I can generate a billion random png and then pick out all the bright blue ones	0
oh is that going to be used on the game?	0
yeah I was hoping to do that	0
like the images I showed you a little while ago	0
i see	0
I can make as many of those as I want	0
but most of them are crap	0
that thing also reduce the color depth	0
so if I set up a filter to select only interesting images, then I can make a huge amount of sprites fast	0
I only need an algorithm to determine what is interesting	0
like self similarity	0
you migth be able to add a "-depth -colors 16 " to convert	0

imagemagick is such an amazing thing	0

well I will show you my janky code	0
also who needs any video editor when you have ffmpeg	0
https://pastebin.com/xG0tDhgz	0
Title: janky - Pastebin.com	0
those are some lines of randoness	0
cant you... loop	0
well at first I thought so	0
but the problem mattf is that the command to imagemagick is all one command	0
i see	0
but I could use an array or something for the numbers	0
yes it's stupid	0
but it works	0
I made this in 5 minutes	0
yeah well the important part is it working	0
I just googled how to do a simple thing in imagemagick and then I pasted it	0
just to test my concept	0
I did not expect it would look this good	0
so now I will rewrite it	0
i think you could loop filling an array and in the end interpolate the array join it... but who cares	0
bash is such a weird lang	0
tiv makes it look really cool and retro by representing it as blocks	0
so I want to make imagemagick replicate that blocky effect	0
it makes even crap art look interesting	0
oh yeah	0
some of these look like faces	0
the basic drawing tool is just a line with a rounded end	0
it is just changing the thickness and the color and positions	0
you could filter on average color and then filter again on total distinct colors	0
then use those different sets as backgrounds, spirtes, etc. as needed	0
if you had a function to take two of these random images and find the midpoint image between them, you could generate random animations	0
by just taking the midpoint image between those two, and then between the new image and one end, over and over again until you find the midpoint image between any two	0
oh the midpoint image between two	0
what would that be	0
well say you have 256 colors	0
so it would be the average of those two pixel values	0
if you have one image that is 0,0,0,0,0,0	0
and the other image is 255, 255, 255, 255	0
so then the average image should be 127, 127	0
i see, i wonder how crazy that would look like	0
but would it make any sense	0
yeah	0
it would be an interesting experiment	0
it would be weird	0
like some gas morphing constantly fading	0
but it should still look recognizable if enough source images are the same	0
if you gave it enough of the same thing, like a dog running	0
you could generate more middle points	0
and then it tried to fill in 30% more	0
take 5 steps, weighted averages	0
I think Photoshop can do this now,	0
like adding more floors to a building	0
add more windows	0

I think we should make a #english	0

#master-race	0
loudercake: I did not open an #english chat room, because English is kind of a de facto default	0
there is #lobby though	0
all the rooms here are kind of English-centered	0
But isnt this server mainly romanian focused	0
an #english chat room would not have anything specific to it	0

how's the jam, loudercake 	0
its goin	0
I came up with some ideas for the music	0
I will have an intensity variable	0

and then I will play a segment of music at a time	0
so I will have a soundtrack of something like 10 minutes in an ogg file	0
but then I will slice it into segments of 30 seconds	0
if each slice is the exact same size, it should not affect the beat	0
I was going to do MIDI for the music but I think I will hold off on that for now	0

https://github.com/matheusfillipe/Space-Explorer/tree/master/shaders	0
here's the basic premise of my game so far	0
Title: Space-Explorer/shaders at master · matheusfillipe/Space-Explorer · GitHub	0
there's a room with a chair and a table in it	0
im mostly just editing and combining shaders from that site	0
on the table there is a radio, a vase with a flower, a teapot and a teacup	0
but they are all so close together on the table that if you touch any of them even gently you could nudge one of the other items off the table	0
the item is a rigidbody2d	0
it has gravity and it will drop to the floor	0
and then its sprite will change to a broken sprite	0
so like a vase that drops will change its sprite to a bunch of random triangles	0
there is a timer, you get some amount of time like 2 minutes	0
and things could happen every second, like a cat could appear and knock a vase off a table	0
each level has different kinds of furniture	0
and the goal is?	0
pick up an object?	0
that's what I am still working on	0
I can't decide if I want to prevent things from getting broken or cause things to be broken	0
you could try to prevent the things from hitting the floor	0
but it would also be fun to break stuff	0
https://imgur.com/a/1rb4VoN	0
Title: makeshift - Album on Imgur	0
hmm i think you guys are already with half of the time left	0
it seems you are making the art handyc	0
https://imgur.com/a/25r1i2a	0
Title: Imgur: The magic of the Internet	0
yes	0
that is my art	0
the whole game is just a test of course	0
how do you paint that	0
I just drew it with a mouse in a paint program	0
i see	0
I used a simple program called Paintbrush for macOS similar to MS Paint	0
the wall is actually a blown up image from that other bash image generator I showed you using imagemagick	0
it's just a test image	0
I will do the wall again	0
and redo all the furniture also	0
Here is one thing I am working on	0
a vase or an egg falls onto a piano	0
and it plays the corresponding piano key when it hits	0
each piano key is a button child of the piano object	0
I am using texture buttons so that I can have the key move down when it gets pressed	0
then each piano key maps onto a wav of an actual piano	0
nice, i hope you can submit in time	0
well mattf I have a method for these kinds of things	0
learned from many years in grad school having to make deadlines	0
I make the entire thing in outline first	0
and then I kind of fill in recursively as I get more of an idea what I am doing	0
for example in this game the physics are not done yet, but I have 7 levels already	0
so when I am done with the physics I can apply it to all 7 levels	0
so I work on what I know I can get done now, and then budget my time based on things I don't know yet	0
I know that I can do a timer, dropping an object and hitting the floor, and changing the sprite to broken, and checking for a win condition	0
so I will be able to submit a game in time, that is not a problem	0
but whether or not the game objectives will be fun, etc., that is unknown	0
i see	0
nice plan	0
well that's how I approach most things in my life	0
I take an iterative approach to lilfe	0
life	0
because I know that the first try is always going to be bad	0
but practicing something over and over will always lead to some improvement	0
I think most of the best games have a great story	0
even if it's a game that does not seem literary, like Candy Crush	0
it's still nice to have a plot	0
and I think the ideal number of chapters is about 7	0

are you handsome? mattf 	0
yes i've got some couple of hands	0
oh "ha ha"	0
mattf: I want to properly troubleshoot the mic problems I am having	0
without public humiliation	0
it is not a hardware thing	0
that is ruled out	0
sox detects the microphone without problems	0
it is Skype: most of the times, Skype does not detect the mic, but sometimes it does	0
so far it seems to be pretty much random	0
I will reward you by honouring you publicly in this channel, mattf 	0
.tell Lumy I will talk to you later	0
.tell mattf You are feral	0
.tell loudercake Are you feral?	0
hi	0
idk, skype sucks, use telegram	0
telegram on my laptop? does that exist, mattf?	0

mattf where can i get proxies	0
well i told you that day	0
youtube said i cant watch a video because its geolocked and im feeling petty	0
yeah but i forgot	0
oh for that you need a vpnj	0
vpn	0
yay -S protonvpn-cli	0
protonvpn-cli c	0
choose some, enter	0
it is free	0
protonvpn-cli d # disconnects	0
dont forget, take a note	0
man kde shit has a bajillion dependencies	0
like	0
tf is kcontacts	0
are you using kde	0
why are you using kde on a crappy computer	0
im not	0
start using a WM like i3 rn	0
and why do you want to use kde software	0
most software has some dependency on kde stuff	0
hey mattf 	0
hi	0
will I also need Emacs? is that it?	0
no	0
wth man	0
this is just the telegram desktop qt app	0
the problem is that its been a while you dont upgrade	0
ooh you called me "morron"... I explicitly requested assistance without public humiliation :)	0
ok	0
but you call him boy	0
handyc: how is yer gayme goin	0
mattf it's coming along	0
I figured out how to seek to any position in an ogg file	0
oh yes	0
with the audiostreamplayer node	0
so I have a 10 minute long ogg file and then I seek to different positions to change the theme of the music within a level	0
or something like that	0
yeah	0
you can also change the track it is playing	0
I am using audioplayer2d but I am not using the 2d features	0
oh nice, okay	0
oh dont do that there is a non 2d one	0
:gh cluen global	0
:fgh cluen global	0
https://github.com/matheusfillipe/cluennector/blob/master/scenes/global.gd 	0
Title: cluennector/global.gd at master · matheusfillipe/cluennector · GitHub	0
check how i managed the music there	0
why, does the 2d one take more resources?	0
I was thinking I might use the 2d feature at some point	0
because thats supposed to play stereo and positioned sound	0
I see, nice	0
yeah but I might want that mattf	0
idk, start simpler	0
like what you said yesterday	0
well it was easy enough to implement	0
even with the AudioStreamPlayer playing ogg's sometimes have some delay	0
playing short wavs is more instant	0
like for button effects and so on, theres nothing else you can go with besides wavs, otherwise huge delay	0
yeah but this is for music	0
I decided not to do the MIDI idea	0
it is complicated indeed	0
yeah	0
but it's still a nice way to have a ton of music at basically no cost	0
otherwise your game is going to add 1MB for every minute of music	0
music in ogg is usually small	0
yes but it adds up	0
I want to have a lot of music	0
like 7 hours of music	0
thats a lot	0
yes I know	0
guitar hero 22	0
ok	0
is music a fundamental part of the gameplay	0
it's part of the gameplay	0
one of the extra cards is to make the music change with gameplay intensity	0
i see	0
thats a nice feature	0
it's all just an experiment anyway, mattf	0
of course	0
so I will do what I can	0
it's just something to learn	0
yes	0
gasconheart: 	0
mattf: ?	0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlMrz9IzsdY	0
ok	0
oh! a song about an ox!!!	0
yes!	0
named bilau!	0
Romanians would love this!	0
;)	0
"ox" is a common insult there	0
do you know what bilau means	0
orangeFl1: that is your song!	0
oh my	0
yes!!	0
is that the name of the ox? hahahaaaa	0

the women in the audience sing that so happily :)	0
we had a short blackout	0

gasconheart: of course, thats hilarious	0
thanks for sharing that, son	0
that was great	0
thats some good brazillian music for u	0

how are you, mattf 	0
I am reverting to Openbox now	0
working on my rc.xml now	0
I's been a great ride using KDE and XFCE for the last months!	0
a really great ride	0
but it is not a ride for me	0
I may revert back even to plain tty at some point	0
orangeFl1: listen to my news bulletin	0
hi gasconheart 	0
i read	0
hey mattf 	0
I can't find xclock on pacman or Aur	0
xclock is one of the oldest UNIX apps of all time, so what gives	0
what is xclock	0
a clock?	0
it is called xorg-xclock	0
while you are on the gui you could try octopi	0
is like synapse for pacman	0
supports aur too	0
oooh man	0
how can you remember it is called xorg-xclock instead of just xclock? congratulations, feral boy, I do admire you	0
octopi	0
i just googled	0
archlinux xclock	0
"remembered"	0
ooh	0
you cheated :) hahahaha	0
you can search with pacman	0
I know	0
I am lazy though	0
pacman -Qs xclock	0
I couldn't even remember that you could search with pacman!!	0
oh great	0
that will also tell you it is xorg-xclock	0
I will TRY to, err, *remember* that	0
hah	0
where is your notes program	0
things everyone should have is a notes program and a clipboard manager	0
I do, I do	0
I have a huge markdown text file for that	0
huge indeed	0
I pandoc it to html to browse it with elinks	0
my notes program is Vim	0
:P	0
well that takes a while to use	0
specially if the file is too huge	0
it does	0
damn telegram	0
mattf: hey	0
hi :|	0
thanks again, man	0
np	0
your help was pure gold, feral boy	0
I tested also Skype	0
it might work now too	0
it works GREAT with both microphones	0
it does, it does	0
I called my mom	0
twice :)	0
to test the mic on both Telegram and Skype	0
my mom has a question for you, mattf 	0
cool, well, was just a pulseaudio problem	0
me?	0
exactly!	0
yes; you	0
I talk to my mom about you all the time, mattf 	0
she knows who you are and what you're capable of	0
so,	0
she needs to customize Telegram's audio notification when she gets text messages	0
she says it is barely audible	0
oh my, the typical grandma complain gasconheart 	0
you have to change the alarm tune on her phone (my grandma puts a whole 3 min song)	0
or just increase its volume	0
oh, is that typical, hm, it makes sense	0
how do I get to the "alarm tune" configuration?	0

loudercake you befriended a duck in 9.981 seconds! You have made friends with 187 ducks in #romanian.	0
i have been trying to make an ai that tries to dodge the ball on pong	0
hah	0
sounded like such an easy tas	0
i am going insane	0
gasconheart: somwhere in the settings, explore on your phone first, sounds and alarms	0
loudercake: welcome to the club	0
of insane people	0
ok mattf 	0
loudercake: hello!	0
buna	0
when distance from ball to ai is less than D_dodge, if the velocity vector of the ball.normalized - (ball.position - ai.position).normalized < some_offset meaning it might collide: do move away	0
some_offset is a vector, you coudl check angles instead of normalized	0
i think there is a .angle or something	0
you could always:   def vec_x_angle(vec): return math.atan(vec.y/vec.x)	0
for degrees:   def vec_x_angle(vec): return math.atan(vec.y/vec.x) * 180/math.pi	0
does the when in that pseudo code mean if	0
yeah	0
you have to try to understand the idea	0
i wished i knew arithmeic well enough for advanced game mechanics	0
you can do with an area2d	0
yeah that what i was trying to do	0
that is much bigger than the ball	0
whenever it enters you dodge	0
there is also a ray casting node	0
i can share the source code if you wanna check out my mess	0
to check if things are aligned	0
well	0
go ahead	0
put things in source control	0
yeah i should	0

keep in mind that this jam has accesibility in mind	0
ha, I know	0
they all do	0
that looks not very accessible tbh	0
i mean	0
dat font	0
i will probably not get many points on accessibiliyy	0
oh the font	0
I am going to change that to a dyslexic friendly font	0
OPTIINS	0
i mean i dont have dyslexia and it still hurts to read	0
yeah it's just a test image	0
the colors are all messed up also because I did them late at night with a reduced blue screen	0
sure	0
i focused mostly on the objects today	0
are you doing the ui idea	0
the menus i am going to go over a little later	0
no this is a totally different idea	0
you nudge the objects and they fall off the table	0
all of the things in that picture are 2d rigid bodies	0
you can nudge them and they will fall and hit the floor and then change their sprite to a broken sprite	0
.tell mattf wow	0
oh yeah	0
i shouldve typed the whole message	0
.tell mattf the AI is (almost) very good thanks a lot	0
do you have the source available somewhere mattf	0
handyc!	0
yeah?	0
god mattf has become my fucking mentor or something	0
wasn't he already?	0
kinda ig	0
do you have the source code somewhere so i can play it handyc	0
or isnt it even done	0
no loudercake the physics are not coded yet	0
you made the menu first???	0
What do you mean	0
I make the whole game at once	0
I made 7 levels	0
But I still need to finish coding the physic	0
physics	0
It's a very art heavy game	0
oh ok	0
the physics are not as complex	0
man youre really taking this seriously	0
do you like it?	0
i am serious about learning godot	0
so I want to see how close I can get to making a real game in the time we have	0
if I focus on the theme each time, then after a few of them I should have some nice different components to use in my own custom engine	0
well i hope you can finish it in time	0
there's no doubt about that at all	0
I came up with my own streamlined process	0
I draw the pictures on ordinary typing paper with a fountain pen	0
then i take a picture with my phone and send it to the computer	0
then I reduce the scale to make it fuzzy	0
and I crop out every object and save it as an independent image	0
then I edit each object with an MS Paint clone and add the color	0
pinta?	0
no, Paintbrush for macOS	0
oh ok	0
well i hope the art doesnt turn out to be too obnoxious	0
do you think the art is obnoxious now?	0
I am going to modify the colors a little when it is morning again	0
right now I can't see blue	0

loudercake you befriended a duck in 131.321 seconds! You have made friends with 190 ducks in #romanian.	0
ideas don't need to be complicated to be good	0
the best ideas are still great even when reduced to their simplest form	0
yes	0
pure truth handyc	0
this little game is far much funnier than cluennector already	0
yeah it's a nice concept	0
handyc why is emasc correcting me on "${TO BE VERB} + ${Verb in past tense}"	0
is that incorrect to say: the spring is compressed	0
no it's not incorrect	0
is there a better form	0
in this case compressed is a past passive participle	0
・゜゜・。。 ​ ・゜゜\_​ø< FLAP FL​AP!	0
.bang	0
mattf you shot a duck in 2.155 seconds! You have killed 557 ducks in #romanian.	0
which is a type of verbal noun	0
it's a compressed [spring]	0
compressed is functioning like an adjective	0
an adjective made from a verb, that is what a past passive participle is	0
is is highlighting "is known" here	0
also highlighted	0
like drunk, chipped, smashed	0
yeah	0
also highlighted	0
those are all PPPs	0
that is not incorrect right?	0
it's not incorrect	0
is there a better form though? why is it highlighting it	0
I am not sure	0
weird	0
maybe because it is telling you not to write in passive voice	0
and that would make those things passive voice	0
for example, I can say this, "The dog bit the man"	0
"the man is bitten"	0
it is often considered bad form in certain types of writing to use passive voice, because you avoid naming the subject explicitly	0
so for example if you are writing a research paper on the Buddha and you say, "it has been theorized that the Buddha was black"	0
you want to avoid that because you need to say who is doing the theorizing	0
oh yes i know t hat form is weird, we have something similar in portuguese	0
so if emasc is trying to be like a literary coach then that is probably why	0
but i dont know another way to say "the spring is compressed"	0
but in technical writing it's not wrong at all to say "the spring is compressed" because there is no agent there doing the compressing	0
you wouldn't say "physics compressed the spring"	0
so in this case the rule function is overfitting	0
:P	0
it thinks you are speaking in passive voice when actually you are just being technical	0
that is the best way I think I can put it	0
for example I could also say, "this is the machined component"	0
no one would ask me who is doing the machining	0
because in this case the PPP functions like an ordinary adjective	0
if the PPP would be better replace with an actual verb, then it makes sense not to use that construction	0
but if the PPP is acting like an adjective, then it does not make sense to change that	0
I started writting a little sort of article while i had not internet	0
trying to rediscover physics on my own and solve some random problems	0
 	0
my mom liked the game	0

she never beat 1-1 in SUper mario bros tho so idk if she is a good source	0

a useless game idea	0
a godot wrapper for pacman	0
Lmfao	0
if you want to install a package you have to beat the pacman game	0
honestly better make it console only, using curses or so	0
Hmm	0
maybe pygame or ,... well what is a thing we want to learn	0
its a funny idea :P	0
But like	0
Only 3 people would check it out	0
i dont think so	0
i think this would go viral on arch community	0
because it is hilarious	0
but yeah wont be the biggest deal ever	0
so you have to play and win, just to install a package? :)	0
would  still do it if we can learn something on the process :P	0

maybe yes	0

oh yes	0
in the end we are just invoking pacman or yay :P	0
Oh god imagine this	0
A game where you have to shoot enemies so a file starts compiling	0
Building the linux kernel would take forever	0
my god :P	0
run the makefile line by and you have to beat one level per line	0
and it gets harder	0
loudercake: well thats too much, for a joke pacman/aur wrapper it would be enough to have to beat a random level per command	0
or here is another idea	0
this one could be a godot game	0
you have to find the packages you want on the huge pacman game grid	0
and eat them	0
and then leave when you are done	0
and you can die by ghosts and have to start again :P	0
well there should be a level for uninstalling and a level for installing	0
maybe one level for each alphabet letter or so, but this has to be dynamically generated	0
like octopi but you choose the packages on a pacman game :P	0
no menus or anything, you choose things by doing mini levels	0
pacmaniac :P	0
Sounds tough	0

tangerineDisease	0
I like it	0
wow	0
tangerinecake is back	0
yes there is a show tonight	0
not on trampolines	0
.w son of the beach	0
(handyc) Son of the Beach :: Son of the Beach is an American sitcom that aired from 2000 to 2002 on FX. The series is a spoof of Baywatch, with much of the comedy based on sexual double entendres, puns, innuendo and the like. A... :: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_of_the_Beach	0
see you in com everybody	0
hello	0
hello	0
that was great	0
i think people were really bored 	0
usually they interact more	0
I hope your horrible problems are not really too horrible	0
maybe bored, I am not sure	0
but I do the show for myself anyway	0
whatever happened to northernlights? he used to come to every show	0
they are manageable	0
I think s/he has a lot going on in its life	0
let's just say a lot of stuff pilled on	0
there's some stuff you should know about Northernlights	0
on me	0
He she is a pretty messed up character	0
just use they/them	0
Very smart person but mentally unstable	0
really?	0
hmm, didnt see them like that	0
I don't like to use they/them because it's a single person	0
That's why I'm telling you	0
they seemed fine	0
because I didn't realize at first either	0
what makes you think that?	0
yeah, I think she probably has borderline personality disorder or something	0
Do you know tob?	0
briefly	0
She really did a lot of sick stuff to him	0
You can ask him about it	0
Tell him I mentioned it to you	0
Send him a private message though	0
You can send private messages in com	0
so northernlights is indeed a she??	0
born female	0
yes	0
i dont know how to do anything in com	0
besides type stuff	0
type 'h' for help	0
one second, I need to go apologize to my wife for being loud	0
I guess I woke my son up	0
but he went back to sleep	0
She is kind of annoyed but she will get over it	0
i sent him a message	0
We are going on a picnic tomorrow	0
but no idea how to go to the conversation	0
like if it were a room	0
is that possible?	0
no it will simply appear	0
there's no room	0
・゜゜・。。・゜ ​ ゜\_​ó< QUAC​K!	0
.bef	0
orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 2.248 seconds! You have made friends with 172 ducks in #romanian.	0
the private message will simply appear on a new line	0
and it should be in color	0
then you hit 'a' to reply	0
and i have to press "s", type his name and the message everytime?	0
ah, a to reply	0
ok	0
no, just the first time, then if he write back you can 'a'	0
cool	0
tob is a good guy	0
northernlights I wouldn't trust with anything	0
we were trying to get her removed from SDF for a while but we kind of gave up	0
i thought northern lights is a good guy too, but i guess you never know who really has a penis and who doesnt	0
yeah, that's why I'm telling you	0
She's definitely a brilliant person	0
but she's extremely messed up	0
but what could she have done so messed up	0
to warrant you removing her from sdf?	0
one time she locked the anonradio room with a password during tob's show and wouldn't let anyone else in	0
barnacle is the best guy	0
and then she sent tob 300 messages	0
barnacle is an asshole	0
HAHAHA	0
thats weird, never knew tob had a show	0
so tob has a penis	0
tob has THE show	0
I haven't checked on tob's penis but you are probably right	0
SNL?	0
that is THE show	0
I thought he told you about his show	0
Dubious Goals Committee	0
SNL sucks	0
idk, never watched SNL	0
that show hasn't been funny since 1994	0
no, tob never did tell me about that	0
we are not really friends per se	0
oh, well you should check it out	0
it's the best show on anonradio	0
whats it about?	0
it's mostly him walking around in a park and talking about animals	0
and then also playing weird music	0
are you sure he isnt the mentally unstable one?	0
it's good, you should check it out	0
no he's the only sane person on SDF	0
i mean, granted, i did see some weird ass people here, but they are all smart in their own way	0
people can be insane and also smart	0
like northernlights	0
she's very smart but extremely insane	0
country of origin?	0
USA	0
Oregon	0
was studying for a PhD in something like Russian linguistics and had some kind of breakdown and dropped out or was kicked out	0
he answered	0
of course, USA	0
the land of the mentally unstable because you cant afford mental healthcare	0
yep	0
thats sad	0
sure it's sad	0
sadder than my life right now	0
I'm sure she's not an entirely awful person	0
but watch out, don't get hooked	0
hooked on what	0
she can be charismatic	0
she is, i enjoy talking to her	0
I wouldn't reveal too many personal details to her	0
so did tob, before I told him who she was	0
northernlights is the new nick, because we all hated her so much after the stuff she pulled under the old one	0
i wouldnt reveal any details to anybody there anyway, besides my country of origin and some mild, general stuff	0
okay	0
OPSEC	0
tob can tell you more stories	0
i was hesitant to reveal any details to you as well, but well, you are charismatic too	0
it was pretty nuts for a while	0
yes of course	0
you should be careful	0
not you, personally, more like gasconheart	0
:)	0
I've been to gasconheart's house, he's a cool guy	0
he may or may not have farted on my pillow	0
but it makes sense to be cautious with anyone online	0
well, i wouldnt have had no way of knowing when i came here	0
That's one reason I do like to meet people from online	0
It's much easier to get a sense of who someone is by meeting them in person	0
We were able to establish that you are not a vampire or at least a garlic-resistant vampire	0
So you are either fairly safe or possibly super dangerous	0
fair point	0
i told you several times before that i like garlic though	0
my first ever selfie!!! https://ttm.sh/bcA.jpg	0
yeah but you could be lying	0
dedicated to loudercake and mattf 	0
hello orangeFlu 	0
gasconheart are you the one on the right?	0
hello handyc 	0
51 !	0
is that taken in your bedroom closet?	0
I think so, the image got mirrored	0
gasconheart: who is that woman on the picture?	0
a supermarket	0
what did I send??	0
don't mess with me	0
I have a longish audio clip to share with the sdf gang! wait	0
bye for now	0
I am just wondering which has more alcohol content, those bottles or you	0
hahahahaha	0
hahahaha	0
mattf please write a special script to reveal the rest of the room by analyzing the reflections in his glasses	0
ok	0
you could use blender for that	0
handyc: do the private messages not appear if tob sends them while i am writing one myself?	0
they should always apppear	0
i've seent this guy using blender to simulate how many pills there were in a flask and his result was very good	0
I've never had a problem with that	0
based on a picture	0
you mean for those guessing games, mattf?	0
yes	0
like guess how many beans in the jar and you win a prize?	0
cool	0
yes	0
it is cgmatter	0
the best blender channel out there	0
thanks, I will look into that	0
coudl also be default cube	0
it is the same guy	0
have to go in a little while, we're taking a small road trip tomorrow	0
we started building a WALL	0
and I haven't packed	0
around the house	0
I am not sure if I have clean underwear	0
s/e$/es	0
around the houses	0
I am running low on underwear	0
i dont even wear underwear anymore	0
well, thank you for telling me	0
nice	0
good job mattf 	0
going commando	0
orangeFlu those electric cars are pretty nice	0
but I am still getting used to how they do gearshifts	0
you wear a loincloth mattf 	0
the layout in all the electric cars is really weird to me	0
handyc	0
I have tried 3 different models now	0
is there something like taking picture of someone and the person wont let you publish it	0
whats the law about it	0
what is this called	0
image property?	0
mattf, it varies by country	0
so	0
yeah maybe	0
hang on	0
does that exists for animals	0
animals of other people	0
pets or cattle	0
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography_and_the_law	0
Title: Photography and the law - Wikipedia	0
but I am still getting used to how they do gearshifts - what gears, there are no gears	0
I wouldn't expect it to apply to animals unless you were taking the photo on private property	0
but it's best not to guess with law	0
it could be anything where you are	0
i see	0
https://thebrazilbusiness.com/article/authorization-for-taking-photographs-in-brazil	0
Title: Authorization for Taking Photographs in Brazil - The Brazil Business	0
germany	0
'''It is legal in Brazil to take photographs of “private persons”, with the premise that they are in a public space and that the image does not hurt its privacy rights.'''	0
oh for Tina?	0
https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/photography-laws-germany	0
Title: Photography laws in Germany - All About Berlin	0
'''In general, you can take photos of people in public spaces, but there are some exceptions.'''	0
'''You can't take photos of people if it shows their helplessness1, 2. For example, you can't take photos of accident victims, drunk people or nude people without their permission1, 2, 3. This also applies to celebrities1.'''	0
'''You can't take photos of people if it violates their privacy. You can't take pictures of people in their home, or in a changing room1. You can't take photos of naked people in their garden1. This also applies to celebrities1.'''	0
yes	0
'''You can't take such pictures, even if you don't share them1.'''	0
well thats people	0
what about animals that belong to people	0
'''If you share a photo of someone, you need their permission first'''	0
like a horse	0
'''You do not need permission to take, share and sell photos of buildings and vehicles in public spaces. '''	0
I think a horse would be classified as property	0
it is on private property but the picture is taken from a road	0
*tob@otaku* When she first showed up, she thought she was a pretty badass hacker and she fucked with the wrong people. It's the same old sad story of the gunsliger who walks into town to be Top Dog, but doesn't realize he walked into the town of the baddest gunslingers in the West.	0
oh but also this, mattf	0
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jun/22/germany.animalwelfare	0
Title: German animals given legal rights | World news | The Guardian	0
yes, that's exactly what happened, orangeFlu 	0
i see	0
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_selfie_copyright_dispute	0
Title: Monkey selfie copyright dispute - Wikipedia	0
i cant tell if you guys are messing with me	0
he said she never was a phd candidate and that was her bulshitting	0
oh my god handyc	0
thats actually hilarius 	0
orangeFlu I don't know the details of her academic career, only bits and pieces, but I have verified that she was in grad school at one point	0
I'm not messing with you at all	0
I wouldn't talk shit about someone like that	0
PhD candidacy is different from PhD studenthood	0
do you happen to have tob's email?	0
I am not sure if she was ever in a PhD program but I believe she was in an MA program	0
I don't know for sure if she got the MA, I think she did	0
i am not sure how the phd stuff works in the us, here you are either a phd candidate or not at all	0
never heard of such thing as a "studenthood"	0
tob said to contact him by email for the long story because it is long	0
it is long indeed	0
so do you have his email?	0
what I mean is that being admitted into a PhD program is not the same as becoming a candidate	0
You become a candidate after you pass comprehensive exams	0
it's just his name @sdf.org	0
curious, there are no exams here as far as i know	0
well that's how it works in North America	0
just the final one, where you present your thesis	0
I had to sit in a room by myself with no notes or anything and answer these essay questions for several hours	0
I read some 60 books just to prepare for the exams	0
that's called the defense	0
at the end	0
in North America, you typically take classes for a couple years, then you take comprehensive exams to establish that you understand the content of the classes and also your own special topic of interest, then you write your dissertation for a few years, then when your supervisor thinks you are ready, you schedule a defense	0
Usually by the time you get to the defense, it's just a ritual, because supervisors don't generally let their students get to that point if they don't think the student is ready	0
My defense was pretty easy	0
but my supervisor was brutal	0
Even the dissertation proposal, I had to rewrite about 20 times, just to get authorization to begin on the actual diss	0
jesus	0
how long does it usually take?	0
here its between 2 and 5 years	0
if you pass, of course	0
i've heard of people taking longer depending on the subject	0
orangeFlu 	0
I was in graduate school from 2002 to 2016	0
but my situation was a bit unique	0
I got two MAs	0
then I did an entire PhD program up to the comps and switched to a different school	0
so my PhD program where I actually got the PhD, I was there from 2010 to 2016	0
that's not atypical	0
for a humanities degree	0
that makes more sense	0
sciences usually are faster	0
well, tob is composing an email for me	0
in language-centric programs you have to spend a lot of time learning the languages before you even begin your research project	0
yeah, truth be told, the only people i know that have a phd are in computer science or physics	0
good, I'm glad he can fill you in on the details of that	0
it's up to you what you do with that information, but I wouldn't feel right seeing you talk to northernlights without knowing some of this stuff	0
orangeFlu you know me	0
and you know my wife	0
well, i did already talk to her several times	0
she also has a humanities PhD	0
yes i do know you and your wife, idk why you keep mentioning that :))	0
because you said the only people you know that have a PhD are in computer science or physics	0
but you know me and you know my wife, we both have PhDs but not in CS or physics	0
oh, that	0
i thought it was a call to trust	0
ha ha	0
reffering to northern	0
it was so disjointed from what you just said	0
no, you don't have to trust me at all, but I would feel bad not telling you what I know about her	0
i had to connect them somehow	0
yeah I understand	0
now i need to think about how you will introduce me next show	0
depraved clown	0
former caveman astronaut	0
disjointed schizophrenic afficionado of depraved hentai, his hard drive died about 5 times while i introduced him just now	0
did someone say hentai	0
yes!	0
its the more ethical version of porn	0
i dont know why people are so against it	0
why have porn, where a lot of trafficking is happening, people get abused and there are a lot of shady practices	0
when you can emply a small studio of animators and voice actors	0
employ	0
are there people against hentai?	0
I'm still stuck on the phrase "depraved hentai"	0
like what other kinds of hentai are there	0
romantic	0
doesn't the word 'hentai' literally refer to perversion?	0
yes	0
'''Hentai is a kanji compound of 変 (hen; 'change' or 'weird') and 態 (tai; 'appearance' or 'condition'), and means "metamorphosis" or "transformation". In sexual contexts, it carries additional meanings of "perversion" or "abnormality", especially when used as an adjective;[1]: 99  in these uses, it is the shortened form of the phrase hentai seiyoku (変態性欲) which means "sexual perversion".[2] '''	0
from the Wikipedia, peace be upon it	0
weird change	0
weird/change appearance/condition	0
・゜゜・。。 ​ ・゜゜\_ó​< QUACK​!	0
there are hentais surrounded with themes such as rape... or non-consensual vaginal arbitrage, as i like to call it	0
tentacle rape	0
and there are normal hentais, more romantic	0
mattf: yes, there are people against it	0
well, maybe not against it per say, they just believe its much more fucked up that people do erotic anime instead of normal porn	0
well i understand if people are against pedo shit, there are hentai with pedo shit	0
s/per say/per se	0
well, maybe not against it per se, they just believe its much more fucked up that people do erotic anime instead of normal porn	0
there are.. but honestly?	0
s/.+/i love hentai	0
i love hentai	0
i would rather pedophiles would masturbate to that rather than doing some fucked up shit to some real kid 	0
cause pedophilia is inevitable, it will appear	0
yeah i agree with your view	0
s/pe.+ld//	0
i would rather  masturbate to that rather than doing some fucked up shit to some real kid 	0
i actually dont know if pedophilia hentai is illegal or not, it probably is	0
not quite	0
i guess if you dont mention they are kids, but give them kid-like features, it could be argued in court, if need be, that it is not a kid	0
there are whole animes like that	0
shit	0
they say they are 400 year old beings 	0
that looks like 11 yo kids	0
:)	0
ok...	0
because of course it is still anime	0
it has to be some alien girl that falls from space into your house	0
makes sense	0
and she doesn't know shit and they dont wear clothes on her plannet	0
and their greeting is rubbing their breasts on your face	0
handyc: he said he sent it to me on my SDF address	0
where the fuck is that	0
i thought he meant that address i used to sign up on sdf'	0
but i dont think so, cause i didnt get shit	0
orangeFlu: were you validated	0
yes	0
by handyc	0
handyc: who validate me? you?	0
the mattf account	0
i mean, he said he validated me, idk if he really did	0
it has always been him	0
mattf I believe I did, yeah	0
no orangeFlu, you have SDF mail	0
go to the shell and type 'mutt'	0
oh, god	0
you just cant use smtp :?	0
you are orangeFlu@sdf.org	0
not mutt	0
smtp is for monthly paid ppl only	0
mattf regular users can't use SMTP anymore	0
you can still use imap and pop3	0
is what im saying	0
oh maybe so	0
yeah that's true	0
s/?$/\/	0
but probably easier for him just to type mutt	0
oh damn	0
first use of /	0
s/?$/\/	0
s/?$/\	0
s/?$/x	0
s/of/of my penis	0
<handyc>: Your find is much shorter than your replace and you didn't even use proper regex. Stop trying to do lame stuff and send a proper message again if you need to!	0
s/'/'/test	0
hah	0
s/\//test	0
stest'/'/test	0
s/\/test	0
how to replace a slash mattf	0
not possible	0
oh really	0
yeah	0
thanks a lot Gödel	0
what did you expect	0
i wrote that	0
I expected I could do it with an escape character	0
of course it is completely broken	0
i'm sorry, what the fuck	0

ok, so whatever is in that mail.... fuck me	0
orangeFlu: there is a web interface	0
orangeFlu you don't know how to use a computer?	0
fuck your web interface	0
you can use imap and pop3	0
oh yeah that's true	0
there is squirrelmail	0
i read the email	0
you can't use smtp without paying	0
sdf mail really sucks	0
oh I see	0
i am not swearing at mutt	0
you are saying the fuck me because now you know	0
tilde is all free	0
mine is also free	0
i am swearing at what the fuck i read in that fucking cursed email	0
no mattf, he successfully read the email now	0
this is the stuff of nightmares	0
yeah	0
hah	0
pretty weird, right?	0
yeah??????	0
ok, gotcha, dont mess with smj	0
now you see why I felt obligated to tell you	0
i dont know who to fear more, smj or jparsons	0
ha, I mess with smj all the time	0
smj is an okay guy	0
i dont think you messed with him the way she did	0
what did she do to smj?	0
I don't remember that part	0
thats what she said	0
you did, the stuff with locking the room	0
and berating smj on being a poor admin and hacker	0
yeah but smj didn't really do anything about it	0
he said he did	0
he even encouraged her to get a show	0
yeah, i read that	0
well if he did something, then why is she still there?	0
orangeFlu: yay -S gasconheart	0
smj likes to wind people up	0
from what i understand, smj has her under observation irl	0
he likes the chaos of SDF	0
oh yeah?	0
well we all know where she lives	0
if tob is to be believed	0
like the exact location	0
the building and the room	0
and we have photos of the building	0
well, i guess thats how you know	0
because of smj	0
I am the one who got that info	0
no	0
that was my own doing	0
orangeFlu: yay -S gasconheart	0
 damn, you are all some scary motherfuckers, please forget my name and location :))	0
orangeFlu: yay -S gasconheart	0
we did all kinds of stuff to track her down, it was a fun game for a while	0
how the fuck did you do that	0
track her	0
I have many skills	0
tell me	0
it wasn't too hard	0
orangeFlu: yay -S gasconheart	0
he just ran the who command	0
People reveal all kinds of things about themselves online	0
come on	0
No, I did more than that	0
:P	0
looked through old high school yearbooks and stuff	0
why do you want me to install that, mattf, what is that	0
found mailing addresses, lots of stuff	0
orangeFlu: just some funny thing i made for gasconheart	0
just connecting one dot to another	0
oh, yeah, i made the same thing with my psychologist	0
orangeFlu I even know where mattf lives:	0
Brazil	0
nice	0
wow	0
didnt know that	0
yeah and he speaks Brazilian	0
and i know where mattf too	0
thats true!	0
and even english on a good day	0
orangeFlu: yay -S gasconheart	0
mattf is actually a spambot	0
mattf: i dont feel safe installing that	0
surely it is some keylogger	0
clone the repo, check the script	0
its just a shell script	0
how do i clone the repo...	0
ok	0
never done this for aur	0
for dumb people liek you	0
there is an easier version	0
nc mangle.ga:8888	0
or 8080?	0
sorry i never cloned an aur repo	0
I don't think it's a keylogger but the weird thing is every time I run the script I grow an extra testicle	0
nc mangle.ga 8888	0
I've run it five or six times now and it's getting to be a little painful	0
thats it	0
fine, i will do it myself	0
mattf you are in Brazil right now, I traced you	0
that command is basically the same as the script but without lolcat on the lines	0
You are in Bolsonaro's bathroom	0
im cleaning his ass now	0
oh you said bathroom	0
is there a bathroom and a pooproom?	0
and a pissroom	0
and an ejaculation room	0
dickroom 	0
another name for pussy	0
this is a good joke in portuguese	0
gasconheart: are you there	0
portuguese people have "casa de banho, casa do carro and casa do caralho"	0
fucking making me install ruby	0
ruby?	0
this is why you have 3000 packages installed	0
does lolcat depend on ruby	0
damn :P	0
idk, but its installing a shit ton of ruby shit	0
nc mangle.ga 8888	0
telnet mangle.ga 8888	0
there is a tcp version	0
how come you dont have ruby anyway	0
what kind of dev are you	0
why the fuck would i have installed the slowest and most useless language i know	0
hah	0
they built github with that	0
look, i tried ruby some years ago	0
it was shit to me, even back then	0
well you are one of those java devs	0
C	0
C#	0
i tried ruby, c, python, lisp, haskell	0
is just java from microsoft	0
:P	0
and ruby was the shittiest	0
C# is a really good language and a very good framework behind it	0
the shittiest lang to me is bash	0
:P	0
ok, yeah	0
agreed	0
ruby is fine, have you ever tried sonic pi	0
ken: stimmt du das?	0
orangeFlu: Wait if you're a girl prove it. 	0
handyc: did sonic pi work?	0
never heard of sonic pi	0
code music	0
live	0
its fun	0
loudercake should try it too	0
Is it that programming language for concerts	0
orangeFlu: the emacs users use something called overtone for that though, it uses closure	0
oh, i heard about it	0
clojure	0
the java lisp	0
i used to like clojure until i learned it works on jvm, then i said no thanks	0
yeah, bloat	0
i like scheme and common lisp	0
and god damn, haskell	0
yeah	0
and emacs lisp!	0
i wish i could work more with those	0
its ok, but seems like a subset of common lisp, its missing a lot of neat features	0
nah honestly lisp is not pretty, well i get confused with the parenthesis	0
i just had something installed for that	0
you get really used to them after a while and your brain counts them automatically, so you know exactly where a block ends	0
i have rainbow colorize thing 	0
yeah, i had that too	0
looks very pretty	0
loudercake: is more like eletronic music loops. 	0
well that could be concerts sure	0
there was a guy that was streaming him making his own openCL library in common lisp and programming a game in that	0
Pushing pixels with Lisp	0
(with-lisp (push pixels))	0
hah	0
how can you like functional langs and stil like C#	0
i loved watching him, but i havent seem him streaming in like a year	0
what the fuck is wrong with C#	0
my impression from c# is the same from java	0
its so easy to work with onceyou know what the fuck you are doing	0
boilerplate	0
its so different from java	0
well i haven't tried it indeed	0
the boilerplate code in the latest c# is like a few lines	0
i have tried java	0
they got rid of the bullshit class Program and static void Main stuff	0
cause its noise	0
so java like	0
you just write top level code as if you were in python	0
oh?	0
you mean all global like	0
like a bash script :P	0
yes, for the main stuff	0
well that is nice	0
what about that one class per file rule	0
i dont think that was ever a rule	0
its a suggestion	0
but it definitely works with more than one class in a file	0
on java is a rule	0
so in c# is a suggestion	0
but its advisable to have different classes in different files	0
but what i do	0
well it looks definitely less horrible than java then	0
is usually if i have some classes that have a common purpose, i just put them in the same file	0
for example claims for users	0
and authentication stuff	0
but for controllers, yeah, different classes in different files, it just feels more organized	0
yeah i just dont like when the language or libraries or whatever is more about what you can't do than what you can do	0
that is what is so cool about python	0
it is a hacky lang	0
C# doesnt care about files, you jsut need to have the namespaces sorted out	0
when you start burying things with OOP and private members you cause some trouble for the hacky users	0
well, yeah, C# is not for hacking	0
its for large scale projects	0
oh like C++	0
something like c++, but no need to include stuff, cause thats dumb	0
what do you mean	0
including what stuff	0
say i have a namespace A, with some classes and stuff in another file	0
and in Program.cs i want to use that	0
i dont need to include that file	0
i just write A.ClassINeed	0
oh it is aware of the files that are part of the same project?	0
yeah	0
oh thats interesting	0
mattf I did not have time to try sonicpi yet	0
i think i haven't seen that in any lang	0
my wife keeps planning these day trips now that the weather is nice	0
she can't drive, so I have to drive	0
it has a lot of fucking cool stuff that nobody fucking knows unless you use it everyday	0
we are going to the zoo tomorrow	0
the generics are so well built, the async, everything	0
its a pleasure to work with	0
orangeFlu: what about editing or adding methods to libs you import, i forgot what was that called	0
rust has it, dart has it	0
extension methofs	0
yes	0
we have	0
;)	0
some people are saying all those languages like C#, C++ and Objective C are all going to be replaced soon by hanb	0
i dont mean extending or so	0
thats what they are called	0
no like: subclass extends parentclass...	0
no, of course not	0
i mean just changing one method on the original class itself 	0
for that "scope"	0
say a library has class A with method F	0
yes	0
with hanb you don't even need to write code like that, you just say into the microphone the kind of program you want and then walk away	0
i can modify that	0
ah thats nice	0
hanb is the future	0
like rust and dart	0
but you can't look at hanb while it's making the program, it's too dangerous	0
or add stuff to the class as if it were written by the library developer	0
well i should try C# someday	0
the best way is to tell hanb what you want and then run out of the room	0
can you give a hello world example handyc	0
as long as you don't look directly at it you're pretty safe	0
yes thats what i mean orangeFlu 	0
this is a nifty feature for hacky people	0
mattf: be careful, there will be a lot of stuff you wont know how they function and they seem daunting at first	0
yeah so if you want to do hello world in hanb it's pretty simple, just say "hanb do hello world" into the mic and run away	0
what i mean by hacky is lazy that dont want to learn too much and just get stuff working	0
hello world is a pretty small program so you should be able to run fast	0
orangeFlu: yes 	0
it really isnt hacky in any way	0
because if you don't leave the room fast enough you could get sliced up	0
sorry to tell you	0
that's just how hanb is	0
i know it is still java like	0
i was thinking...maybe i should learn wordpress for doing some freelance jobs?	0
loudercake: sure	0
or javascript	0
plus getter setter methods? fuck me, those blew my mind	0
but like I said, if you don't look directly at hanb while it's working then you are usually pretty safe	0
orangeFlu: oh, well that has become norm on most oop langs though	0
peep the horror	0
even gdscript has this :P	0
you can do in python but it is always hacky	0
python OOP is hacky	0
in java, you declare a private member, and make getter and setter methods for it, but in c#, just `string Username { get; set; }`	0
I can't sleep	0
want to make the setter private? `private set;`	0
are you still on the beach	0
orangeFlu: I like the way dart does it	0
in a caban, yes	0
whatever the spelling	0
settlers of caban	0
hahahaha	0
loudercake: js is nice to learn for real	0
cabin	0
i dont know how dart does it	0
well the whole frontend stack	0
loudercake: html. css and js	0
then you can do a site like mine	0
the three horsemen of hell	0
this headhunter emailed me today on LinkedIn	0
hahahaha	0
they want a Python/django person	0
handyc: what company	0
i get those recruiters like twice a day	0
it is annoying	0
I don't know the name of the company	0
yeah it is annoying, because usually the job doesn't match at all	0
"Would you like to relocate to Kiev for a C# job?" No, i fucking wouldn't, Brenda	0
orangeFlu: do you use chrome or firefox	0
I told him I would talk with him on the phone on tuesday	0
mattf: firefox	0
yeah but this job is near me	0
well my site looks better on chrome	0
and it's some company that focuses on animal welfare, which is nice	0
im not going to link because it looks better on chrome :P	0
i dont think its good to use animals for warfare	0
it probably won't work out, but I'm always open to talk with people about jobs	0
as long as the animals consent, it's okay	0
thats true	0
bestiality? same?	0
that's an interesting question	0
I'm not sure how I feel about that, to be honest	0
i've never seen a dog consent to anything more than eating and going out to make peepee	0
or the poopooo	0
well I would imagine a healthy male dog invited to have sex with a woman would have himself a fine time	0
i dont think he understands what he is getting himself into, even more so if the woman is into bdsm	0
I think it depends on what species 	0
crazy rights defenders would argue thats dog rape though	0
really dangerous territory	0
I don't think it's crazy to talk about animals having rights	0
well, they do have rights	0
if someone raped a cat, I think that is wrong	0
because it could physically damage the cat	0
obviously it is wrong	0
not if it was a male cat and a female human 	0
but a dog, a pig, a sheep are about the same size as a person	0
i was kidding with the bestiality thing	0
but what if the animal raped the person	0
oh, well I think it's an interesting question	0
there was a case some years ago about a dolphin that had sex with its trainer	0
the dolphin was male and the trainer was female	0
it was consensual	0
damn	0
and when the relationship was forced to end, I think the dolphin got depressed and died	0
yeah, dolphins are very attracted to us sexually for some reason, not sure why. so do ostriches	0
so are*	0
maybe i could get a dolphin girlfriend	0
unadvisable	0
hi mattf 	0
hi	0
I can't sleep	0
cool	0
well they have brains about the same size as ours	0
mattf: I'm trying to join several .mp3 files with sox but it fails, it gives an error, what are my options, feral boy?	0
probably similar level of intelliigence	0
gasconheart: what errors	0
cant ffmpeg do that	0
idk	0
:cht bash join multiple files ffmpeg	0
I don't use ffmpeg	0
I will check the errors and report back	0
I'm converting them to ogg first, then I will try to join them	0
gasconheart: ffmpeg -i "concat:file1.mp3|file2.mp3" -acodec copy output.mp3	0
This will concatenate two mp3 files, and the resulting metadata will be that of the first file	0
source: stack overflow	0
seems to be it	0
oh nice	0
will it work with like 7 files?	0
then convert to ogg	0
yeah	0
ok	0
if it doesnt, just work them up two by two	0
mattf: where in that code do I have to add files 3 to 7? thanks	0
no way orangeFlu 	0
why not	0
I'm lazy, remember	0
jsut add the files to the concat argument	0
where is the problem	0
yeah	0
gasconheart: you can also create a list.txt	0
concat:file1.mp3|file2.mp3|file3.mp3...."	0
with 	0
file '/tmp/01.mp3'	0
file '/tmp/02.mp3'	0
file '/tmp/03.mp3'	0
and so on	0
then $ ffmpeg -f concat -i mylist.txt -c copy output.mp3	0
I will try that mattf, thanks!	0
list.txt	0
then	0
sox failes to convert some of the mp3 files to ogg!	0
sed -i list.txt 's/^/file /' f	0
oh thanks also for that command	0
s/f$//	0
sed -i list.txt 's/^/file /' 	0

<handyc>: Your find is much shorter than your replace and you didn't even use proper regex. Stop trying to do lame stuff and send a proper message again if you need to!	0

use regex	0
I need to study more to do it	0
s/o.g/christianity	0
sox failes to convert some of the mp3 files to christianity!	0

no i just wanted to use regex	0
yeah I have only seen a few clips of it	0
and that's funny joke anyway	0
I know the basic plot	0
me too	0
i never finished it	0
I can't really stand watching those long series	0
fixing good	0
I don't have the time to commit to it	0
handyc: you should get a second screen	0
do you watch black mirror handyc	0
hahaha	0
loudercake: yes	0
i am watching DT right now	0
no I have never seen black mirror but I read about it	0
I read Wikipedia summaries of shows that look interesting to me	0
im chatting with tina watching DT chatting here and working on duel 	0
Doctor Tony?	0
if something looks really good I might watch it	0
handyc: im using that laryx thing to translate telegram messages into audio	0
so i dont have to read it	0
oh yeah?	0
pretty simple	0
does it work well?	0

I am not sure if you know, I was thinking about becoming a monk for a while	0
but not now of course	0
what about attack on titan	0
i will start watching the last eps now	0
I would like to see that, haven't seen it yet	0
watch for life	0
the only show I have watched regularly in the past few years is Rick and Morty	0
oh	0
when is it back	0
loudercake I grew up in a house with TVs on all the time	0
the show is called "for life" btw	0
tv on the bathroom	0
When I was in undergrad I decided one day that I didn't like TV anymore and I sold my TV to a pawn shop for $13	0
and I haven't really watched TV since then	0
thirteen dollars for a TV??	0
I do have a TV, but it's almost never on	0
man pawn shops are a scam	0
of course they are a scam	0
but it was an easy way to get rid of the TV	0
it was a small TV	0
I paid $100 for it	0
ok so	0
now that TV would be worth about 50 cents	0
quick rant about streaming	0
the seasons are always so incomplete	0
what do you mean?	0
like back in the day i wanted to watch a cartoon	0
and it only had season 4 in netflix	0
back in the day for loudercake is like last week	0
shut you're mouth up	0
back in my 20's i used to watch anime	0
now you watch japanese cartoons	0
shut I am mouth up?	0
yes Mr. Mouth	0
loudercake: now i dont watch	0
im blind	0
do you intentionally use the wrong form of your to be cool	0
well duh	0
its sarcasm	0
that's not what sarcasm is	0
oh god please	0
well duh, of course i dont know how to type 	0
lets not start another argument about grammar	0
that's not about grammar	0
you don't understand what sarcasm is	0

thats literally what i was trying to do	0
NOT PENIS MEASURING	0
trying but not succeeding	0
oh sorry gasconheart 	0
do they make rulers that small	0
sarcasm is like if i said, "loudercake, you are so great at writing and I'm so amazed that you write so well," in a really exaggerated way that indicated I mean the opposite	0
i see	0
irony is getting run over by an ambulance	0
irony is when a fire truck catches on fire	0
well then	0

oh heavens	0
wow	0
when you have to explain the joke it loses something	0
also,	0
nobody would know that word	0
the verb is "to come"	0
"cum" is a noun	0
You don't cum, you come	0
coming ?	0
im coming today?	0
come again?	0
Yes	0
stupid	0
this is an english flaw	0
It's not, "I'm cumming," it's "I'm coming"	0
ill always say cuming	0
or cumming	0
then you will look like an idiot, not like a cunning linguist	0
it's an old joke among linguists, mattf	0
a cunning linguist is not an idiot	0
gasconheart surely knows the joke	0
I get it	0
i bet you'll look like a fucking idiot alright when having sex with a linguist	0
gasconheart did it work, file was missing?	0
the file was not missing	0
I know you get it, but I think you must have heard it before me saying it, that's what I meant	0
gasconheart: the "file" keyword before the file names?	0
these guys are telling me that nobody would know the word cunnilingus	0
I will try that now mattf 	0

goodnight, I need to sleep now so that I am awake for the zoo tomorrow	0

goodnight handyc 	0
take care, have fun on the beach	0
handyc: good	0
thanks bye	0
mattf: the output files is corrupted.... but so are all the mp3's I'm trying to join!!	0
what?	0
It does not make any sense	0
so it works?	0
it corrupted the original files?	0
it 'did something'	0
it seems so!	0
well that sucks	0
download them again	0

gasconheart: we are building a fence	0
my dad didn't find workers for it so we are doing ourselves once again	0
I could have come to give a hand	0
a fence against boars?	0
mattf: the original mp3 files are *not* corrupted	0
cmus can't play them, but mplayer can	0
mpv is the true player	0
the output.mp3 file *was* corrupted though	0
ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i <(find "$(pwd)" -iname '*.mp3' -printf "file '%p'\n" | sort) -c copy output.mp3	0
on a dir with the .mp3	0

damn why dont you make a copy of the mp3 on a dir	0
I did	0
same result, corrputed merged file	0
how annoying	0
zero bytes file actually	0
gasconheart: 	0
pacman -S mp3wrap	0
yes, son	0
mp3wrap output.mp3 *.mp3	0
ok	0
sounds too good tobe true	0
no it is bad	0
ffmpeg could just do this too	0
easier	0
well im sure that script is just a ffmpeg wrapper	0
but you have to supply endless prams about codecs and things nobody has no idea	0
so being stupid is the problem here	0
oh! not a 0-byte file!!	0
let me try to listen to it	0

are you sure you have any mp3 file in that folder	0
that has more than 0 bytes	0

no idea 	0
do you want me to send the files to you?	0
maybe you can join them	0
put them on the pi	0

so	0
i will try later	0

I didn't finish talking about my steak	0
then finish	0
I had the worst steak I've ever eaten	0
it was so fatty	0
and with no flavor	0
and overcooked	0
a guy came to our table and asked how the food is	0
usually I just say "everything is great"	0
but this time I could not hold back	0
I said, "It's really pretty bad"	0
He was very apologetic	0
He asked me to describe what was bad about it	0
I told him that pretty much everything about the steak was wrong	0
it was a bad cut of meat, too fatty	0
it was overcooked	0
it was unseasoned	0
He offered to get me something else from the menu	0
I said, "Is it going to be the same kind of meat?"	0
He said, "No, I am sure it won't be"	0
I ordered a different thing that was like meat on a skewer	0
and it was great	0
maybe they were training a new guy or something	0
I don't know what happened	0
It is truly a meal I will remember forever	0
well	0

less worse	0
yes, it's called jailbreaking	0
less worse, nice	0
orangeFlu: are there any advantages on doign that?	0
i havent seen people do cool stuff with it	0
cause people dont develop firmware for apple	0
is there a termux for it	0
can i install Xcode on it and build for ios on it	0

because their hardware is so closed, you cant find schematics or anything, so every firmware would need to be reverse engineered	0

and then he started getting really mad,	0
I don't think the recruiter actually knew much about the technologies at all	0
and he said, "hey, this isn't a conversation"	0
and I said, "okay, what is it? you called me to tell me this company is interested in me"	0
and then he started getting really abusive and shouting at me	0
it was bizarre	0
and he shouted at me, "if you don't answer some simple questions for me you won't get the job!"	0
idk you should have just said "ok"	0
so I told him it was not professional to shout at people	0
damn	0
and that if he thinks I'm not a good candidate for the job maybe he should find somebody else	0
ok 	0
Why would I say, "okay" to any of that, mattf?	0
and ?	0
Actually what set him off is that I told him, "You can put down whatever you like on the form if it gets me the job, but I was talking about clean code and not Django"	0
yeah 	0
I don't think it's a very good company anyway	0
whenever he said "im not sure about your skills whatever" 	0
well	0
I think he was saying those things to try to lower the salary	0
maybe 	0
I don't think any company obsessing about clean code like that will last very long	0
or just because they want to test if you aren't getting mad easily :P	0
I didn't get mad, the recruiter did	0
and thats the test	0
I very much doubt that	0
me too	0
I think it was an incompetent recruiter working for an incompetent company	0
most likely	0
I don't want to work for an incompetent company	0
and I am fortunate enough that I don't need to	0
im helping gil to migrate to a new DO account	0
the position sounded much less interesting to me after the first interview anyway	0
oh really?	0
yeah	0
I check up on Roses from time to time, but it doesn't seem like anything is happening	0
not really	0
I	0
I am glad it provides you with some extra income, though	0
yes	0
I think it's good that I left his project when I did, because I don't think anything good would have come from me staying in it	0
well idk	0
no idea :P	0
you do have some idea	0
handyc: im getting an iphone :P	0
and an older but much better than my current android phone	0
mattf, the dark side?	0
and you say it without a trace of shame	0
im exchanging my new phone with an iphone and my dad's old phone (the mics stopped working)	0
well it will be good for apps development	0
yeah maybe	0
I am not sure how that works, though	0
but look at that deal :P	0
is the kind of thing that only works with your parents	0
:P	0
you probably have to send Apple a stool sample every week to stay in their dev club	0
its 100 usd per year for appstore	0
if you want to put apps there	0
that's lame	0
but good trade for you, yeah	0
ofc :P	0
oh i think i can use circleci to build flutter and godot for ios	0
what is flutter	0
flutter?	0
cross platform apps	0
in dart	0
oh	0
started as mobile but now all platforms	0
but I don't want to learn 200 new languages	0
I am still working on Godot	0
we will make the next jam handyc	0
we 3	0
but I won't have time to do anything for this current jam	0
okay let's do it	0
well unless you start the egg job	0
no mattf I do not think that guy will contact me again	0
lol :P	0
but there will be other egg jobs	0
well unless you have a crazy trip again[	0
or weird guests	0
for legal reasons, though, it's probably better for me not to have that kind of job right now	0
i see	0
because it could mess up the visa I have based on my own company	0
if I take another job, it's not possible for me to work fulltime on my own company, my visa is based around the idea that I work fulltime for my own company	0
so I think I would need to apply to change the visa to be supported by whatever new company hires me	0
but then if they don't renew the contract after a year, I could be in a bad situation	0
that is one reason I have not been taking the interview stuff very seriously	0
maybe you find a job where whoever you are working from hires your company	0
if I did find a really nice job with good pay that seemed like a good fit for me, I would take it	0
like if i had to work remote from brazil i think i would have to start a company here	0
yeah I floated that with one of the recruiters,	0
to be legally corrected	0
hire my company instead of me	0
correct	0
but I think it makes more paperwork for them and they would rather just find some other more boring candidate	0
companies such as that one prefer to have candidates that can do one thing well,	0
and have very boring lives,	0
people with a lot of interests who travel a lot are not as good	0
well mattf, there's a skilled labor visa that companies can use to bring you from Brazil to NL	0
that's how I got here in the first place	0
it is basically a visa that says, "we could not find sufficient qualified candidates for this job within the country"	0
yeah you have to move then	0
well you should move, mattf	0
come to Europe	0
could i move and still have a remote job	0
:P	0
yes	0
thats what i want	0
you could move to Europe and look for remote jobs in Brazil	0
:P	0
and starve to death	0
actually you might consider looking at Portugal	0
also a very nice country	0
and you wouldn't have any language problems	0
yeah maybe	0
europe is small	0
yeah	0

(loudercake) You tried befriending a non-existent duck. That's freaking creepy.	0
i was going to do it but I had to do other stuff	0
I didnt felt like it	0
we went to belgium	0
The theme was kinda tough	0
I came up with some ideas	0
I was thinking of doing the Chinese 10 kings of hell	0
they judge you for 3 years after you die	0
and then you get reborn	0
it seemed to fit well with the theme and the wildcards	0
but I didn't have time	0
Chinese hell is called earth prison	0
everybody goes to the hell	0
and then a judge reads your crimes	0
and sends you to a different department depending on what you did	0
hell is underground	0
you get judged and then 7 days go by and you get judged again	0
7 rounds of 7 days	0
and then there are 3 more judgments at something like 100 days and 1 year and 3 years I think	0
That sounds hard to make	0

doesn't have to be hard, you don't have to fill in all the details	0
if the description is more than 2 lines it is too much :P	0

I got it to a point where it always does 1:1	0
look in #bots	0
ok	0
it will always do that pair perfectly back and forth	0
man my icing is so clippy	0
interesting handyc	0
yeah mattf do you think that could be the basis for a game	0
like finding perfect audio text pairs	0
hmm no	0
oh really?	0
like wordle	0
this is heavy and sucks	0
but for audio and text	0
yes but it wouldn't have to run on that server	0
if 4 people use this at the same time the server might die :P	0
we could find some other way to do it	0
locally on the user's machine	0
using javascript	0
handyc: well yeah	0
have you tried sonic pi	0
im still working on it	0
no not yet	0
do you have an audio with inalbidle sound	0
like 1 hz	0
what do you mean, can I generate it? 	0
i figured out i need to keep streaming this as a "comfort audio"	0
I have sox	0
there was some command to do that	0
do you know the command?	0
I have to look it up	0

yes	0
you can pipe it to anything and save it	0
i need to keep streaming that because pure silence streamed with ogg vorbis	0
and the 5 specifies 5 seconds	0
the players don't know what to do then	0
you could do any amount of time	0
i need constant	0
or you could continue steaming it forever	0
*streaming	0
i think i would need to stream this over jack though	0
you should be able to	0

mattf here is an idea	0
generate random pink noise and feed it to the speech to text engine	0
lol	0
and then feed that output back into the text to speech	0
nice idea	0
you could generate rpg countries that way with different cultural variables	0
like regional speech accents and stufg	0
stuff	0
loudercake: it can take any file given the size and len limits i placed and that ffmpeg can convert it to wav and ffprobe can check the length	0
and given the ALLOWED_AUDIO_EXTENSIONS	0
mattf  I have found that if I listen to pink noise for a while I start hearing voices in it	0
pink is somehow the perfect frequency for certain combinations to sound eerily similar to a human voice	0

you buried it with random noise ideas	0

which sox command	0
play -n  synth 5 sin 1	0
mattf my icing still clips through the donut :(	0
above command generates sine wave of 1 Hz for 5 seconds	0
the amplitude is too big	0
or maybe this thing doesn't know what to do	0
no the amplitude is too high	0
loudercake: start again	0
-v 0.9	0
loudercake: i know it is hard to start again but sometimes is really needed :P	0
i started over 5 times now	0
oh	0
loudercake: how much is it, show us	0
play -v 0.001 -n  synth 5 sin 1	0
maybe you can select the vertices, hit "o" for the thing that pulls a whole aread together	0
and fix it	0
play -v 	0
https://imgur.com/TqeJhRh.png	0
handyc: same volume for me	0
loudercake: first close this upper pane, you realize you have a split there	0
 	0
i do tho idk how to close	0
im a blender master	0
on the corder, almost on the edge, on the side of the one you want to close drag it up	0
on the right corner 	0
handyc: that command works for you?	0
no I thought it did but it does not appear to work for me	0
damn cant you control the amplitude of sox synths!	0
man these panes are awful to control	0
not really	0
different 	0
what is the issue loudercake, select multiple vertices and pull them out of the donut :)	0
but that vertice that went down, you gotta fix that one	0
maybe disable the snapping	0
sometimes it is just getting on the way	0
play -n synth 5 sin 1 gain -12	0
mattf use gain	0
oh great handyc	0
play -n synth 5 sin 100 vol 0.1	0
mattf that also works	0
i think i am going to use a very high freq instead of a very low	0
the vol command is not a switch	0
it doesn't have a hyphen	0
that's why it wasn't working	0
oh nice	0
thanks	0
i will use that	0
yeah no problem	0
yes I think vol is better than gain for this	0
play -n synth 5 sin 1 vol 0.1	0
18300 hz	0
i stop hearing after that	0
oh really	0
yes	0
https://imgur.com/L6WFGmR.png DAMN IT	0
with my macbook speakers right now I can't hear very well above 11K	0
loudercake: scale the whole thing up, turn off snapping first	0
oh i see what the issue is now	0
hahahaha	0
you should play around with this layout thing to get familiar with it	0
well I can actually hear something at 20KHz if I concentrate	0
nah handyc	0
no way	0
yes	0
i kinda feel i can hear 1900	0
19000	0
but I don't know if it is really a 20K wave that I hear when I play 20K	0
but this is not as sure	0
is like a speaker issue or so	0
I hear something	0
if you sort of imagine where the sound should be and focus on that	0
play -n  synth 5 sin 400000 vol 0.1	0
lol	0
i can hear that	0
then you can sometimes perceive it better	0
that hurts my ears	0
even 30000	0
it seems to not be able to handle that	0
I don't know the range of macbook speakers	0
they sound pretty damn good for a laptop	0
play -n  synth 5 sin 25000 vol 0.05	0
ill be streaming that	0
oh that only lasts for 5 secs??	0
that helps you concentrate?	0
so thats what the 5 is??	0
how can i make that endless	0
yes change the 5 to what you want	0
I think just remove it	0
no thats so ogg compression sends something instead of nothnig	0
play -n  synth sin 25000 vol 0.05	0
nice	0
no space needed after the -n	0
well seems i will have to use pavucontrol but it doesn't show on pavucontrol :P	0
maybe in jack	0
haven't used pavu before	0
got to go now	0
it's almost 1:00 am	0

sleeping is good for that kind of issue	0
oh damn the windows vm is booting!	0
nice arch linux makes you loose 10 hours every week fixing things that updated	0
but the thing is that you learn some things	0
so many things	0
another thing i learned is that unreal engine is useless on linux	0
well unless you have the 144gb on a ssd and more than lets say 12 cpu cores and a very very good machine	0
like twice of what it takes to run the game itself	0
but on windows it will run fine with half of the resources (because it does on mine, it is at least far more usable)	0
and only takes 25 gb 	0
of disk space	0
conclusion is, use godot	0
now the mac vm... damn	0
Unreal engine is more for big companies with more budget	0
Good luck making anything remotely photorrealistic with godot	0
loudercake: yeah well	0
not really	0
archviz can be made on unreal	0
they made movies on unreal	0
there are way more freelancer jobs for unreal than godot	0
and experience on unreal counts when you want to join a game company	0
even when they dont use unreal there	0
but godot is not respected	0
however there are some photorealistic demos made with godot	0
not as good as what unreal can do but 	0
pretty ok	0
wow you change the resolution of the vm and windows goes through the initial setup, asking for my language, cortana and so on again	0
Looking pretty	0

eu i-am zis ca sunt femeie	0
dar tot imi zice sa ii sug sanii	0
oh man	0
bringing her here was a big mistake :(	0
I am so regretting this now :(	0
usually I handle her messages just fine, in private messages; but she hasn't figured out how to direct message me on Mibbit	0
she never get's tired... she is typing "suck my tits" all day long in private messages; I can take that	0
but now she (he; whatever) is annoying the entire chat room, therefore the community	0
I apologize to all the community :(	0
oh man i should have let me test the ip ban	0
i will remove it because i m not sure if it works or not	0
lets see if she comes back	0
now she saw the message once and never comes back :P	0
she *will* come back, believe me	0
she never gets tired	0
lets see	0
but who is she	0
where the fuck did you find her?	0
maybe the ip ban worked and she knows what it means and didnt come back to test again :P	0
orangeFlu: she is in many of the Romanian IRC chats	0
she uses several nicks, once she was using the same nick my virtual girlfriend from 2020 had, I though it was her, so we started talking	0
she's been a pain in the neck ever since	0
nice	0
i will be going now	0
will come back later	0
hello	0
mattf: i still havent figured out that shit	0
oh that shit :P	0
with the privilege escalation	0
no, sorry	0
with the xss	0
another shit?	0
i have several shits on my mind right now	0
xss is that shit from yesterday no ?	0
yes	0
it might be vulnerable to that but i dont think thats the point	0
yeah, i am suspecting the same thing	0
but also	0
i cant find anything else and its supposed to be an easy task	0
now i am trying to tackle some priv esc	0
xss is useful when you want to steal info from another user or run js on another user. Since it is capture the flag kinda task it wouldn't make much sense. But at least that proves that there isn't any kind of filtering, of sanitization, on the backend.	0
orangeFlu: on the links i sent yesterday there were some interesting vulnerabilities, something about buffer overflow on python 3.6.9	0
yeah, i dont think it's a bufferovverflow on python	0
honestly	0
seems too complicated for a beginners ctf	0
maybe its a python code injection sorta thing	0
i tried, man	0
i thought, maybe, just maybe, the back-end interprets what i type there as view code	0
soemthing like {{ ... }}	0
and it executes the code ther	0
oh yes like one of of those templating engines	0
it could be	0
you have to escape the {{ you are currently in though	0
from inside a variable	0
why, its www-url-form-unencoded	0
there is no way to do that i think	0

Blender managed to log me out of i3?	0
Somehow...	0
loudercake: you sent an image 	0
and i missed it	0
oh i see	0
nice!!1	0
you are getting there	0
let me render your donut when you have it done loudercake 	0
i mean if you do an animation	0
I also want to learn character animation	0
thats a hard thing	0
i played taking animations from mixamo and putting on characters from human3d? smt like that	0
and that anime one	0
god i wished i had anything but a crappy positivo	0
other PCs render a 1024 sample project like its nothing	0
wow positivo!	0
its better than acer, cce	0
only the best brands :	0
vroid studio	0
the 3d anime character generator	0
 	0
that anime thingie	0
doing that stuff from scratch is a whole job	0
also i got a bug	0
cycles preview doesnt work on viewport	0
UNLESS youre on a camera view	0
when did you start learning 3d btw	0
loudercake: oh like 6 years ago, it was blender 2.6 still	0
2.69 i think	0
but i never learned it :)	0
oh 69 is from 2013	0
it was 2015 or 2016	0
oh i can recognize by the thumnails!	0
when did it start feeling "easy"?	0
or atleast not that bad	0
loudercake: it is not easy still :P	0
but when 2.8 came out blender became a human friendly software	0
but there are some things that are completely insane still	0
oh im from the time you used to select things with right click instead of left click	0
like any software	0
i had a hard time making the transition :P	0
well i supposed its atleast fun, right?	0
loudercake: oh yes ofc it is	0
well, i suppose the most annoying part of my journey will be this fucking positivo pc being ass	0
that might be a problem loudercake 	0
I wish i could direct the rendering somewhere else	0
you can redner on the vps :)	0
also sheepit is a free rendering cloud	0
and i would be glad to render for you during winter :)	0
sheepit requires you to render for others before other render for you	0
besides next week is getting hotter	0
and also the vps has small storage	0
loudercake: what ?	0
are you planning to render blends that are bigger than 400mb ?	0
i could never do that :P	0
im not crazy enough	0
*yet*	0
well ok that farm one is like 800mb	0
but thats ridiculous	0
your donut wont be more than 30 mb	0
the vps has 40 gb free	0
yes	0
ok makes sense	0
but how do i do render piping	0
you can leave it rolling forever there 	0
or whatever the techy term is	0
using blender from the cli	0
!lmgtfy use vps to render	0
.lmgtfy use vps to render	0
(loudercake) https://is.gd/wvUkoU	0
and do cpu rendering	0
blender -b softbody.blend -E CYCLES -a /path/to/render/output/frame_####	0

well i havent really used the vps	0
this seems like a pretty good thing to do	0
and it also takes up a lot of ram, as you wished ;)	0
loudercake: well the bottleneck would be the cpu though	0
yes	0
but anything is better than my pc	0
you could let it run the sheepit client 24/7	0
then when you want to render smt you have it	0
but idk if their java thing can run without a gui	0
is not like you can't setup a whole vnc on the vps though	0
i have it on mine	0
remote desktop!!	0
man god bless this vps	0
thanks for sharing it	0
i never tested leaving smt 100% cpu 24h though	0
if it was linode they would complain	0
i did like 5 hours and they didn't say anything	0

orangeflu!!!!	0
did you try that	0
what is the ip again	0
the address of the thing	0
you might have tried that though	0
http://34.107.115.255:30530/	0
i did not try that	0
i have no idea what that is	0
there are some interesting things there	0
do you have time to try it yourself? i am trying another challenge now	0
dont have time for this one'	0
i am now	0
this thing is flask	0
i know it is, mattf, i've known that since yesterday...	0
what is your confirmation?	0
my what?	0
what proved you that	0
werkzeug	0
can't you use werkzeug for all python servers?	0
fastapi, django, there are many	0
maybe, but i've never seen it outside of flask	0
s/servers/api libs	0
can't you use werkzeug for all python api libs?	0
plus, they wouldnt use anything else, it's a simple app with 2 endpoints	0
come on	0
true	0
that is a valid argument	0
and	0
its the simplet shit ever, django is overkill	0
i set a different header like "Content-Type: text/xml"	0
and the error: The browser (or proxy) sent a request that this server could not understand.	0
on stackoverflow it is a flask message, when you dont have the .form argument	0
ok	0
it doesn't accept any other Content-Type	0
it does accept without that header though	0
its supposed to be simple	0
dont go complicated	0
15 teams have solved it from 20 something	0
idk what simple means for whoever did that :)	0
well those are people who work with this	0
no, they are not	0
they are students	0
or highschoolers	0
come on :)	0
dont make us feel stupid!	0
you cant enter the competition if you are older than 25 or not in college	0
i am stupid too	0

then it is that xss	0
the flag is in the format	0

ops should set the example, orangeFlu 	0
this is how I view this chat	0
I accept comments and suggestions for those rules	0
Mystique once made some comments that triggered a super interesting debate here	0
i am not an op though	0
only ocasionally	0
true	0
also, sorry for saying that guy is retarded or a hungarian	0
hey, I don't care for a particular user, you *don't* need to apologize to me	0
I care for the protocols, that's all	0
i understand	0
what i dont understand is	0
was she/he a hungarian?	0
I accept suggestions from the general public; Mystique is not an op either, and she made super interesting observations	0
she says she is Romanian.....	0
by the way she is writing, i doubt it	0
her Romanian is horrible, and not the kind of mistakes a Romanian speaker would make	0
I doubt it too	0
there are mistakes typical for a native speaker, and mistakes typical for foreigners	0
she does not sound like a native Romanian speaker	0

orangeFlu: I can't see anything, that thing tells me to open an account	0
ah, shit	0
orangeFlu: just post a picture, for goodness sake	0
i didnt anticipate that	0
gasconheart: well, i would like to post a picture but i also want people to see my stream	0
i am very ashamed of it	0
and it makes me cringe to see myself do stuff	0
but i am doing this in order to improve my self image	0
post a link to the stream, then	0
apparently it doesnt let you see it either way	0

are you streaming now?	0
coding interesting stuff, having little podcasts as well	0
maybe about language as well	0
not streaming right now	0
it takes a lot of work to prepare myself for streaming + the fact that i have to stream for like 2-3 hours at least, and i dont have time today	0

the first one didnt save	0
ok, everyone is gone i guess	0
apparently i had 13 unique viewers in the last stream	0
that's pretty nice	0
nice	0
did you see the screenshot?	0
is the guy with glasses you? or the other one?	0
the guy in the corner	0
with the red background	0
yeah, with glasses	0
oh the one with the red background; got it	0
yes, you're a handsome young man; approved	0
thanks :))	0
i am also very very skinny	0
you have my blessing to shine	0
alright	0
post a link to your recorded stream	0
my guest appearences on handyc's podcast were also training for me, so i feel more comfortable talking to people i can not see	0
i am going to try	0
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1309700901	0
does it work like this? or does it still asks you to sign in?	0
wait	0
is that a frog in a straight jacket on a wheel chair and a cow dancing?	0
yes!	0
that's the waiting stream	0
those are memes	0
oh ok	0
people in my generation know them	0
people in my generation know who coined the word "meme"	0
people in my generation generated people in yours	0
so did i	0
i forget his name, but i know it comes from the greek "to imitate"	0
ancient greek i think	0
dawkins?	0
anyway, they are famous memes and pretty funny	0
the one on the right is "peepoo in a wheelchair"	0
the other one is "polish cow"	0
you cna skip past those to when the stream starts	0
yes i think meme is from the selfish gene	0
Richard Dawkins, yes	0
oh, i did remember	0
see? not stupid zoomer here	0
I paused it	0
I'm doing other stuff :(	0
I'll resume it soon, son	0
you dont have to watch every bit of it	0
it's pretty boring	0
ok	0
but i will probably stream again tomorrow	0
i will let you knpw	0
if you follow me you will get notifications when i go live	0
if you are on your phone	0
i dont recommend doing it on the desktop	0
i would tell you when i go live, but i dont have a fixed schedule	0
do tell me when you go live! ;)	0
I might watch you from my computer	0
expect tomorrow, something like 5-6 ro time	0
I guess I should open an account with them to 'follow' you; maybe not soon	0

why not soon	0
i could use some follows	0
loudercake: you on twitch?	0
Not a lot	0
I only use it from time to time to see if i can get into a vinesauce stream	0
But mosr of the time i just watch VODs	0
you can watch my stream when i go live	0
or my vod	0
although i have only one vod right now, and it's pretty boring	0
Also do you know any way to sandbox android apps	0
I want push notifications	0
But not with the whole privacy risk	0
I know its dumb	0
Android is inherently completely not private	0
But is there a way?	0
what do you mean exactly? android apps are sandboxed when it comes to storage and access to things like resources, camera, mic, etc. Technically the only information they get is the info you give them when you open the app	0
and the permissions	0
Well some apps need to have storage permission	0
yes	0
Lets take discord for example	0
It has storage and internet permission	0
but they can only access their storage from the emulated drive the have	0
or photos and other stuff you have there if you manually select stuff	0
like when you want to share a photo	0
I see	0
Well thanks for enlighting me on this	0
there are more details obviously	0
i dont know everything about how android apps work	0
but i know there hidden things they have access to, and they shouldn't	0
androi 13 is going to gfix some of that	0
like hidden data collection the way facebook does it	0
mark zuckerberg had a hissy fit when they announced that	0
i have to go	0
and there is a storm outside	0

i was supposed to ask someone else, but everyone who worked on this project is now long gone, i am the only one who knows how stuff works anymore 	0
well, me and the client	0

what color is the cat	0
i kill the cat, i regret, life sad. i get new cat, life good again	0
she was black	0
black like your heart	0
yes :(	0
hahaha	0
black cats bridge the gap between this world and the next	0
oh, boy, it's time to wash the cat again	0
i hope she doesnt suffocate in the washing machine like the last one	0
I found a mouse head just inside the front door of the hall today	0
it would be really incovenient to adopt another one	0
oh? why did you kill the mouse?	0
I didn't say it was dead	0
thats most curious	0
probably all tuckered out after a long night being separated from his body	0
cause the way you phrased it, it seems like you found his head and nothing else, concluding that it was separated from the rest	0
it was indeed only a head	0
but he was not dead	0
is that right, mr handy?	0
I never said it wasn't dead	0
you were under oath when you said it's head was separated	0
objection, relevance	0
establishing character, your honor	0
overruled	0
so?	0
WAS ITS HEAD SEPARATED?	0
sir I just ask you what you like on your pita, if you no decide yet please step out of the line	0
judge: i will fine you for contempt of court	0
and perjury	0
you want extra garlic	0
you want extra garlic is one euros extra	0
...yes....	0
you want or you no want	0
okay	0
ok	0
objection, i love garlic	0
okay we got one more double garlic coming up	0
you want coke or pepsi	0
judge: did you just object to your own kebab?	0
sorry we no sell pepsi product here	0
we all out coke	0
cock is fine, thank you	0
we got fanta 	0

fanta and some lime drink	0
cock	0
not the rooster	0
donut you take on that antitude with me	0
you want extra napkin I charge extra on you	0
one euro for napkin	0
i will falafel you up if you dont give me cock	0
one more euro or no napkin	0
no napkin	0
you got it punk	0
thanks	0
hate napkins	0
you leave my gyro shop and never come back	0
tell your friend	0
one euro napkinn	0
i thought it was kebab???????	0
you thought wrong my friend	0
now you going to pay	0
one euro for napkin	0
one euro please	0
come again	0
do you have google pay?	0
tell your friend	0
thank you	0
youre welcome	0
extra garlic for you	0
thanks	0
thanks	0
thankssssskkkksss	0
please put dick in the hole in wall for receipt	0
ok	0
okay we receive your dick everything in order here have a nice day	0
thank you for gyros, mr trump	0
can i also get a gun? i am going to school now	0
mickey I got another order for guns for school can you supersize it	0
SUPERSIZE	0
did you want extra garlic on those guns my good man	0
no, they should be clean, mr trump	0
and a gopro so i can film it	0
you want regular bullets or pigs blood	0
"nothing could have prevented this: says only country where this regulary happens"	0
yeah	0
it's embarrassing	0
what do you think the solution is?	0
I wasn't even done being apathetic about the last shooting and then already there is another one	0
I think the solution is so obvious that the US will never do it	0
no other country has this problem	0
how can you take away the guns? there is no way people would give them back	0
you don't have to take every gun	0
but nobody needs a semi-automatic weapon to hunt a deer	0
just have a reasonable registration and education system for the guns, and stop selling the ones that only exist to murder people	0
there should be a clear system of buyback: give gun back, get money back. And then implement a very thorough check for people buying guns	0
it's just that easy	0
literally no other country on the planet has this kind of problem	0
i know	0
but the solutions are not that simple and it will take years to get to the same gun culture we have here for example	0
and i dont even want to mention the problems with the police in general	0
why not just have all the people interested in the buyback line up, and we melt them down to make better citizens	0
did you know that in iceland, the police dont have guns?	0
handyc: that would be ideal. I would literally melt all the southern states	0
I am not sure if the police in NL have guns either	0
me neither about romania	0
they do have tasers	0
when we went to Belgium I noticed the police had guns and it really stood out, so I think the ones in NL do not	0
the Dutch police are so friendly, I think they just tickle people instead of arresting them	0
what i see in every policeman: a taser and mace	0
no gun, as far as i can recall	0
the Dutch police do not appear to have any actual function at all	0
there is no crime here anyway	0
and say what you will about romania, but we are in the top most safest countries in europe	0
look at all the vampire deaths in romania compared to other countries though	0
i dont know any, that are newer than 400 years	0
look deep into the vampire deaths	0
you are getting sleepy	0
so sleepy	0
what are ytou talking aobut....	0
i feel not so good	0
so we going to do this game company or what	0
mattf and loudercake and I are going to do the godot game jam	0
in 2 weeks	0
we should make some language games and make 10 million dollars	0
i dont know godot and i don think i have the energy or willing to learn it	0
i would rather code in rust	0
how about a language game called learn romanian or else	0
if its in godot	0
no	0
it will quiz you every day, and if you stop using it an actual romanian will come to your house and beat you up	0
a big guy	0
he goes to the gym	0
and he has a name like fat mike or something, but he's not fat	0
and his name is Ciprian	0
okay cirprian	0
ciprian	0
fat cirprian	0
fat ciprian	0
i have never meet a ciprian that isnt fat	0
yo ciprian someone stopped using the app we need you to go fuck some people up	0
I ate a pita gyro	0
one of Earth's finest foods	0
 yeah, cirpiran also loves pita gyro	0
orangeFlu when are you coming back to NL	0
probably going to be a while	0
i need more money	0
i am leaving for germany in a few days, i will have almost no money after that	0
will you buy mega pretzel in germany	0
i dont really like pretzel's	0
unless they are sweet	0
pretzels	0
you should go to america	0
idk why i said 's	0
buy auntie anne pretzel	0
no thank you	0
will never go to america unless necesarry	0
you can go buy pretzel and get shot all in one trip	0
this is one of the reasons i am not going	0
i already am built like a string of cheese	0
dont want to be swiss cheese	0
in america buy coca cola, watch american cartoon, become capitalist	0
me no like swiss cheese	0
i love coca cola	0
I like cheese	0
but i love it here in europe and maybe aisa and australia	0
asia	0
in america the water for the cola comes from the blood of the exploited working class	0
the blood of kids in a texas school	0
gun flavor	0
new	0
semi automatic, yummy	0
I can kill in half the time it used to take, and that gives me more time to spend with my family	0
I can even shower with it	0
is it waterproof	0
it comes in 6 different colors	0
but is it waterproof?	0
you better order it fast because supplies are limited dumbass	0
you better get off your ass and get to the telephone and order one	0
you are going to be so mad you missed out on this rainbow gun deal	0
i dont think i will	0
if you order now we will give you a keyring with the name of the company on it	0
no I don't think you understand this isn't like yes or no with options	0
you are in this thing now	0
you better get to that phone	0
or we are sending ciprian out there	0
and he is going to bring pretzels	0
you better buy rainbow guns from us or ciprian will be at your house in like 5 minutes	0
okay calm down everybody	0
how much would you pay	0
39 95?	0
29 95?	0
19 95?	0
nothing	0
ciprian is going to be pretty disappointed	0
i would love for ciprian to come over	0
i have some chips for him	0
and soda	0
okay how about we send over ciprian and you buy one gun also	0
soda pop even	0
no, just send ciprian, i miss him	0
well the deal is you also buy a gun, we sell these rainbow guns to make a living, I got kids in school	0
how about 9 95	0
you have kids in school? maybe dont sell guns	0
I will give you this keychain also	0
you are part of the problem then	0
the keychain also transforms into a gun	0
no because the guns cancel each other out so it's like zero guns	0
oh my son just woke up	0
sell him a gun	0
he looks angry	0
shooting a gun would maybe make him feel better	0
yes but I don't want holes in the walls	0
it doesnt need to happen within your house	0
Sell him a kitchen gun	0
kitchen gun, now that's an idea	0
Sup now, I gotta gun	0
i really want to know what qualifies as a kitchen gun	0
I actually have 3 guns at home	0
This is for hunting wild boars	0
I think one kid once took a revolver to my school	0
Luckily he didn’t do anything, maybe was a fake	0
fake kid?	0
Fake school	0
mattf: where is ken	0
i miss ken	0
mattf: orangeFlu kicked ken	0
he might not be worthy of the power of the sschtrudel	0
whatever the spelling	0
i dont think there is a t in there	0
mattf: bring back ken	0
gasconheart: i did tell you the schrudel said ken was ok to kick	0
not the schrudel, mattf 	0
"ştrudel" in Romanian, hm	0
I wonder what the original spelling is	0
.dict façade	0
(loudercake) façade: The face of a building, especially the principal face. - https://is.gd/iWIS2c (AHD/Wordnik)	0
that comes from French	0
sschtrudel??	0
orangeFlu: 	0
bring back ken yourself	0
you know that  /kick kicks a user from a channel, not from the server	0
and /kill cuts the connection with the server	0
so /kill ken to bring him back	0
handyc: you didn't play with coq yet man, how disappointing	0
oh! so clever, mattf 	0
mattf: I have a problem	0
I think it is unsolvable	0
me too	0
but anyway... as an exercise	0
oh! really?	0
tell me, son	0
you first	0
how can I help you?	0
ok	0
look	0
O_O	0
yesterday I was "blitz-editing" text files with Vim	0
  O_o	0
I have more than 80 files open, in buffers	0
I would make a modification, a change, then :w  then  :bd	0
full speed	0
blitz-edit :)	0
then I changed  a "[...]" to just "...", saved, closed, and went ahead	0
but I need to restore the "[...]"	0
wouldn't it be a sed taks	0
I can't remember what file it was	0
I know	0
oh one of those files have a [...]	0
that you mistakenly removed	0
is that it?	0
but I was doing that manually... it was LaTeX, I need to visually check LaTeX integrity	0
can't you grep it	0
many of those files have "[...]" or "..."	0
I mistakenly removed the square brackets surrounding the three dots, yes	0
I have a backup of all those files from before I began "blitz-editing" them	0
but many of the changes I made (the majority) are just fine	0
it is only one, goddammit	0
unsolvable	0
how do you know there is one with a problem?	0
because I had an immediat afterthought when I did it	0
I know for a fact that I changed a "[...]" to "...", saved, closed, and right away I realized I should have kept the square brackets	0
in all of them??	0
in one of them	0
in one of the like 80 files I had open then	0
but dont you know which file is it? why you don't know which file is it but know that you shouldn't have done that on it	0
gasconheart: is your problem just adding the [] around whatever is ... on a file that you know?	0
if you have a backup just get the file from there? but since i believe you should have though on your own then your problem might be that you don't know which file is it, but it doesn't make sense that you know that you shouldn't have done this in one file that you don't know which is it	0
if you know there is something special about one of those files then you should use that to determine which one is it	0
is your problem just adding the [] around whatever is ... on a file that you know?  <----- no... the problem is that I can't identify the file	0
ok, how do you know there is one file that you shouldn't have added then?	0
but dont you know which file is it? why you don't know which file is it but know that you shouldn't have done that on it <---------- because I was fast editing more than 80 files	0
there is nothing special at all in that file that I know of.... All look the same, all are LaTeX files	0
you ran a :%s/[\(.+\)]/\1/g	0
or smt like that	0
exactly	0
then why is one of then wrong gasconheart	0
something similar	0
that is what i dont get	0
how do you know something is wrong in just one of them	0
are you running some script to build the pdf or what?	0
because I made the change, saved the file, closed it, lost even the name of the file, and in that precise moment I relized I should not have done that specific change	0
oh you were doing this one by one?	0
I was like making one change every 5 seconds, with more than 80 files open	0
yes	0
"blitz-edit"	0
full speed	0
boom boom boom boom boom boom	0
oh you were automating ins  a dumb way	0
instead of using sed on them all	0
I would not have used sed	0
i think you can use vim on all buffers too	0
anyway gasconheart	0
I had to check when a "[...]" is needed, and when a "..." is needed instead... I need to see the whole context	0
what made you realise you shouldn't have done that on that file	0
idk	0
just an afterthought	0
don't you have a clue why???	0
hm, no	0
is that important? ...	0
so basically you don't know what the problem is	0
I know what the problem is	0
what is the problem	0
the problem is not that you removed the [] on a file that you don't know which is, the problem is why you shouldn't have removed the [] from it	0
maybe you could grep whatever string it is that was on that file	0
if you know anything about that file	0
your problem is trying to find a file	0
I don't know from memory anything specific about that file...	0
basically, yes	0
will that file not compile for some reason?	0
maybe compile one by one printing the name/path and stop when there is an error	0
my problem is how could I retrieve a file I modified by mistake	0
I don't think there should be any error....	0
both "[...]" and "..." compile perfectly in LaTeX	0
so why is that even a problem	0
the problem is that "[...]" is needed there, not "..."	0
oh ok so even though it is valid code it will produce something diffeernt	0
yes	0
those two bits are actually verbatim	0
is there a way you can detect the mistake from the compiled file?	0
to markdown or html	0
well this is hard because you are trying to find something you don't have any clue what it is	0
"[...]" means "a fragment is missing or omitted", and "..." means "I am not finishing this sentence for some reason"	0
oh it is literally "..."	0
?	0
yes	0
literally that	0
i see	0
interesting but doesn't help	0
exactly	0
it does not help	0
you are still trying to find something you don't have any clue what it is	0
I think so, yes	0
so maybe look over the 80 again and you will find it?	0
all I know is that one "..." in one of my 80-something LaTeX files should actually be "[...]"	0
man	0
if you were going 1 by one	0
why didn't you stop when you realized the mistake?	0
you proceed to finish?	0
I stopped	0
oooooh	0
but I stopped after I saved and deleted the buffer	0
so not all 80 were edited???	0
cant you list and sort them by last modification date	0
I made minor changes in most of the 80 files	0
and wont it be the last?	0
oh man	0
not anymore	0
I continued editing files after that	0
damn	0
good idea	0
but too late, hahahahaa	0
ls -ltr ?	0
man you are so dumb	0
why did you continue editing if there was a mistake	0
without public humiliation, thanks  \o/	0
HURRAY!	0
good question	0
idk	0
I was in an editing-spree	0
pdf)	0
gasconheart: 	0
there was still a longer break after the mistake!	0
I was in an orgy of small cosmetic changes in my files	0
hm probably	0
if you didn't modify them after you can compare the detlas between the modified dates and see the biggest gap	0
the gap that corresponds to the time you stayed most without editing	0
or did you have other random stops during your editing?	0
but that would at least reduce the set 	0
check if the timestamps of ls -lrt on that dir makes sense	0
that *is* a good idea	0
check if those timestamps make sense	0
I can't remember if I had other stops while editing	0
I will	0
wait	0
you can even try to eyeball the biggest gap manually looking at the times	0
yes!	0
that's what I am doing now	0
well, some progress:	0
I can exclude all those that are timestamped before May 29	0
so the timestamps make sense!	0
it seems so!	0
do you have perl installed	0
idk	0
for i in *	0
do	0
timestamps.txt	0
done	0
damn!	0
no that will just save the timestamps	0
ok	0
now how to compute the deltas and sort that...	0
working on it	0
actually sort that and then deltas	0
sorted_timestamps.txt	0
check if sorted_timestamps.txt make sense gasconheart	0
oh use a single >	0
sorted_timestamps.txt	0
it's ok	0
now how to loop over those lines hmmm	0
can we use python :P	0
visually browsing the output of ls -ltr is helping a lot	0
give me some time	0
waaait	0
I am narrowing down the possibilities	0
what	0
hm I can't find the file yet	0
but I managed to narrow down the possibilities, I trust it is a matter of time now	0
gasconheart: 	0
curl http://ix.io/3YYG -o sort_thing.py	0
python3 sort_thing.py	0
on the top are the ones with the smallest delay between and on the bottom the ones with most	0
it reads from sorted_timestamps.txt, make sure it is on the same dir	0
sorry, have not had time for coq yet	0
some man never play with coq enough and others dont have time for it	0

https://github.com/matheusfillipe/cluennector 	0
Title: GitHub - matheusfillipe/cluennector: Connect clues (godot game)	0

oh an actor from minas just died	0

i think the tres data is passed into the clue	0
then it is read back in there	0

why should i know this...	0
Its a game that processes text	0

Besides its from 2006	0
 how will you make that	0
You see	0
what will you make	0
As much as this game looks dynamic	0
Its actually pretty linear	0
And it can be represented as a tree	0
sure	0
And i saw the source code for the game since someone decompiled it	0
I didnt really understand much tbh	0
Because its kinda spaghetti	0
But i saw the game is divided on beata	0
beats	0
When the dude opens the door, when youre getting drinks	0
Beats are contexts	0
So what im gonna do is	0
Represent beats as resource files	0
Now	0
I think the hardest part will be defining words	0
And choosing what words to scrape	0
ambicious	0
s/c/t	0
ambitious	0
Because there probably wont be any need for a word such as "blowtorch"	0
Or "splinter"	0

mattf is there an easy way to do this kind of thing: head "https://godotwildjam.com/"	0
Title: Welcome to Godot Wild Jam!	0
head ?	0
do what	0
for example to grab the text from just the first few lines of a web page	0
like how 'head' works for text files but also parse the HTML	0
well there is a pypi package called preview	0
I guess you could run it through a parser	0
there is htmlq	0
is there a way to use lynx to load a screen full of text from a website and then immediately quit?	0
omg dont do this	0
curl website.com | htmlq "some css selector"	0
unless it is js crap	0
1p	0
1p	0
1p	0
10!!!	0
God i hate android keyboards 	0
like that page seems to be pure js crap	0
Im typing a number asshole stop bringing me to the letters	0
normal	0
well that counter is js handyc	0
yeah	0
<div class="elementor-widget-container">	0
<h2 class="elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default">Jam starts in</h2></div>	0
</div>	0
i mean if you curl or use lynx you can't render that	0
yeah	0
it's fine, I just wondered if it were easy	0
no wait	0
https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-46	0
it is when it is pure html	0
Title: Godot Wild Jam #46 - itch.io	0
Fun fact the counter can go negative	0
also  js	0
just have to figure out where the time is coming from, the rest is a js countdown timer 	0
wait	0
Submissions open from June 10th 2022 at 5:00 PM to June 19th 2022 at 5:00 PM	0
that is html	0
when submissions open it is the start date right?	0
that is easy	0
yes	0
curl -s https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-46 | htmlq --text ".date_data"	0
Title: Godot Wild Jam #46 - itch.io	0
that will print that text	0
you can probably brew install htmlq	0
I have htmlq	0
if not you can cargo install htmlq	0
nice	0
now how to figure out that 46	0
curl https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-46 | htmlq div	0
Title: Godot Wild Jam #46 - itch.io	0
What are you trying to do mattf	0
but I am not sure how to filter out just the one I want	0
And handyc	0
get the date of the thing	0
try this handyc: curl -s https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-46 | htmlq --text ".date_data"	0
Title: Godot Wild Jam #46 - itch.io	0
just pass a css selector to it	0
you can copy the css selector from your browser	0
and --text means innerText	0
div class="date_data"	0
.date_data	0
. for class, # for id	0
and tag	0
nothing for tag	0
that worked	0
css selector	0
and you can do any css selector	0
curl https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-46 | htmlq div.date_data	0
Title: Godot Wild Jam #46 - itch.io	0
yeah but div is not necessary	0
but yeah	0
now that 46	0
to <span class="date_format" data-format="MMMM Do YYYY [at] h:mm A">2022-06-19 20:00:00</span></div>	0
pas in --text	0
man i already gave you the command that works	0
oh really	0
3 times	0
try this handyc: curl -s https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-46 | htmlq --text ".date_data"	0

!A temporary solution is to disable this feature using the kernel parameter i915.enable_psr=0"	0
this is picom config. that one didn't work?	0
its a intel intergrated issue	0
but you tried that one out, seems to have worked for most people	0
i have the same kernel parameter btw	0
oh	0
i didnt see that	0
i have this: options i915 enable_psr=0 enable_guc=0 enable_gvt=1	0
you just do as this. vim /etc/modprob.d/intel.conf	0

bro	0

well being a father is tough too	0
yes it is	0
i hope he can have some time but i doubt it	0
he hasnt even been talking much	0
yeah	0
i also hope you help more this time :)	0
didnt i help tho?	0
yeah, i just mean more	0
i see	0
i wonder what this month's theme will be	0
i hope is better than "connect" or whatever it was that time	0
cluennector was one of those "better in the head" ideas	0
this time after we know the theme lets take 1 hour pause before even talking about ideas with each other	0
so we dont bombard each other with bad ideas	0
handyc loves doing that the most 	0
yeah we gotta think	0
then each one will come with his own idea	0
already filtered by ourselves	0
but then how do we decide	0
yeah thats what i was thinking	0
it wouldve been pretty fragmented	0
if we vote, each one will vote for his own :)	0
we use gasconheart as a judge	0
maybe we explain each other's ideas and take 30 min break then to actually consider each other's ideas	0
we could use gasconheart if he is around	0
random picking by gasconheart or reasoning?	0
tough one...	0
maybe we could have a more advanced voting system	0
or maybe reasoning	0
we cant merge ideas, like a point and click and schmup	0
To avoid bombarding each other with dumb ideas, after the theme is presented, we take 1 hour break before saying ideas to each other, if you say anything you loose -1 on your final score. Then, after the interval, we roll a dice to decided which one describes his idea first and he gives himself a score on the classes: [Fun Level, Playability, Doability] and the final score is the average of the 3 (maybe add one more score class?). After	0
which one has presented his idea we give another break, 30 minutes might be enough this time. Then we present the scores for the other 2 (since we would have already scored ourselves). The bigger score is the winner then.	0
and during the making the majority is also the final word	0
merging ideas can be decided after the main idea has been decided	0
of course it doesn't have to be an extremely strict system, we might even run into the same ideas or very close ones, i think the goal is more avoiding bombarding each other with dumb first comer ideas and giving each one enough time to be ready to start talking over things and dividing the tasks	0
im starting to like the idea of scoring the idea more and more, we just need better classes to score this on. but this will force you to imagine the game and judge it	0
loudercake: what do you say	0
also i will let the whole circleci automatic builds ready before the jam even starts	0
hmm	0
yeah sure fine	0
sounds pretty good	0
what about the score classes	0
Fun level and playability, im starting to think this is the same thing :)	0
some ideas sound fun but might not be	0
i know there are the actual jam scores, but it is too many	0
For us doability is important	0
I understand that	0
Fun is important, it is the main score class for the jam	0
what else there is?	0
Also	0
How do we rate playability of a idea?	0
you imagine the done game 	0
but that is the class im trying to replace	0
what are the jam actual scores classes loudercake ?	0
Theme, fun, controls, audio, accesibility and graphics	0
theme? but the theme is chosen by them :P	0
i guess creativity 	0
how different or unexpected one idea is	0
Aka how well you adhere to the themw	0
Not the actual theme	0
oh how close to the theme it is	0
Also there is originality	0
Yes	0
hmm Theme proximity and Creativity	0
so we could score on these 4	0
Fun, Theme Proximity, Creativity, Doability	0
or something like that	0
Yes	0

it's just unregulated cell growth	0
that's why it's so awful	0
you just need one broken cell	0
doesn't that happen because the telomere screws up	0

no I think aging in general happens because of telomere shortening	0
then unregulated growth 	0
unregulated growth can happen anywhere	0
i see	0
it's like a misplaced jmp statement	0
a mutation can happen anywhere, 	0
many mutations lead to nothing	0
but a mutation could also lead to something that should shut off, not being shut off	0

handyc: the plan is we think for 1 hour before starting to bombard each others with random ideas, we think and each one proposes his single idea then	0
yeah	0
so I will log off from IRC for one hour starting when the jam theme is announced	0
that way 	0
that way I can be sure not to say or hear anything	0
yeah we wont be talking about it	0
lets think first	0
I agree	0
but then it would be good to meet after that hour, so that we can immediately agree on something and get to work on it	0

Oh	0
https://github.com/matheusfillipe/blackbeard	0
Title: GitHub - matheusfillipe/blackbeard: Api and cli that scrapes content from different video streaming  ... [trunc]	0
that is a link	0
if it installs, run this: blackbeard -connect https://blackbeardapi.herokuapp.com	0
im going to setup a ci to build it automatically	0
Ok	0
What is it btw	0
does it install for you	0
it is many things loudercake	0
Im getting go wait	0
a single binary that works as an api, or tui, then it downloads the episodes you mark	0
and it is also a little lib for scrapping those video sites	0
Aka piracy	0
oh yeah	0
blackbeard :)	0
Yeah	0
the king of the pirates	0
I figured	0
:)	0
:)	0
still on early stages, the tui will screw up your terminal and ctrl +C will stop working	0
But does it really need to be tethered to your heroki	0
you can still gracefully exit with "killall blackbeard"	0
downloads will restart from where they stopped	0
no but then you needs curl-impersonate locally	0
currently there is only wcofun provider	0
The command isnt found	0
I am on termux btw	0
Its probably that	0
you need the thing on your gopath	0
loudercake: was the go folder created on your home	0
Yup	0
the nit is inside there	0
the go install command was sucessfull?	0
then ./go/bin/blackbeard exists	0
Wait	0
It was	0
./go/bin/blackbeard	0
well ~/go/bin/blackbeard	0
It works	0
Is this fzf	0
no this is another go lib	0
couldn't use fzf as a lib and didn't want to wrap with fzf like you do in shell scripts	0
this thing doesn't have any shell call	0
without curl-impersonate though you wont be able to scrape wcofun... probably	0
there are some versions of libcurl that work for some reason	0
like the one in ubuntu 22.04	0
Well	0
oh no no. 20.04	0
I can scrape	0
awesome! you see the episode list and shit?	0
you are not using the api?	0
Yes	0
I clicked wcofun	0
i mean if you didn't see the list of episodes it didn't do nothing yet :P	0
then you type a search query, for a show	0
It has the episodes	0
oh then it works!	0

well i made it so it should keep cleaning those lines but if it is too low width, like with curl also has that problem	0

the default file picker for Vim	0
ooooh	0
I am using fzf by the way; awesome application, mattf 	0
yes i told you	0
its dmenu for terminal	0
so, what is preventing you from using netwr	0
just set it as the default file manager with xdg	0

I want to use netwr as a standalone file picker	0
I want to use netwr as a standalone file picker, so not linked to Vim	0
outside of vim? thats not possibe	0
just as I can use fzf's output to do anything I want, I'd like to use netwr instead	0
oh man	0
s/(?=..)$/l/	0
i think you can launch vim telling it to run netwr, or just vim /any/path	0
oh you want to capture the output from netwr?	0
i think you can launch vim telling it to run netwr, or just vim /any/path <------- true, but that is not my concern right now	0
not only do I want to capture netwr's output, I want for it not to be linked with Vim also	0
ok so you want to pipe netwr to something	0
not ideal... there are other minimal file managers that you can do that	0
no idea how to make it not linked to vim since it is literally a vim script	0
I do not need a file manager though	0
but a file picker	0
fzf is a file picker	0
yes	0
:P	0
I use either fzf or dialog for a file picker	0
fzf is cumbersome to navigate through directories though	0
there are others	0
fzf is cool to get the output of   ls dir/*	0
i fordot the name	0
file pickers for the shell? that sounds great	0
maybe loudercake knows the damn name	0
dialog has one, it is good, but... often the names of the files don't show because it allocates a small area to the file names :P	0

I have a BASHH key press (F12) that launches a file picker	0
I am using dialog for that, but it is cumbersome	0

.tell handyc https://github.com/abarichello/godot-ci/issues/81#issuecomment-1086920282 and this is why the mac export didn't work	0
no I do not think so mattf 	0
huh?	0
you can export without having it signed	0
I already did that with my initial test project and it did work	0
did you read the issue	0
you were exporting from a mac then	0
yes	0
cluennector was cross compiled	0
okay	0
idk why they have that if you can't actually do anything	0
but what I am telling you is that I attempted a macOS version at the beginning and it worked fine	0
and then at some point in my project it no longer exported properly	0
in any case, I agree that cross compiling is a better idea	0
https://github.com/matheusfillipe/cluennector/releases	0
Title: Releases · matheusfillipe/cluennector · GitHub	0
and I also think it's probably better not to focus on macOS stuff primarily for the time being	0
yeah ofc not	0
but of course the jam requires that we have a mac version	0
it doesn't really, as long as it runs on the browser	0

I would like to learn some Go as well	0
handyc: go is very simple and limited compared to other langs	0
oh really?	0
limited how?	0
handyc: there aren't many things you can do :P, not that you can't code everything, ofc you can, but like saying that C is limited compared to C++. In that feature sense 	0
go is not bloated	0
it has less stuff than C	0
just interfaces and structs. thats all, no enums, no classes, no fancy stuff	0
you can't even have interfaces with fields. All an interface is is saying that the struct should have those methods. Oh yeah you can implement a method for a struct	0
thats how "OOP" is done there	0
but sometimes feels limited because of that simplicity 	0
in the sense that you repeat code	0
i dont know enough go yet anyway, at the same time it has built in multithreating and channels	0
like at syntax level	0
not with some lib like other languages, actual multithreating	0
but different of rust or C it has a runtime	0
and garbage collection	0
Uuuuh	0
take C++, delete every bloated feature from it, make the syntax more python like and remove the ';'. Then add built in multitasking and channels and thats go	0
So for some reason pressing f to edit the cursor radius on weight paint fucks everything up	0
It logged me out of my i3 session	0
And im at the login screen	0
well and there are also things like this reflection package, from the stdlib, that lets you pretend it is python (not literally, just lets you modify things without type restrictions and analyze structs, like loop over their fields, set them, fancy stuff)	0
loudercake: o wow	0
disable the compositor while using blender?	0
It also made polybar use a fallback font for some reason?	0
Weight painting is cursed i guess	0
wow	0

disable the compositor	0

handyc: yeah is not that much to learn	0
I'm tired of learning something and then I have to learn the 50 most popular libraries and then next week there are 50 different most popular libraries	0
well you are describing javascript	0
should it be verbose	0

 open the Camera app and look for Settings. Sometimes this is the classic gear icon, but it might be three dots, while some phones have a Settings option. Tap whichever one you find on your device.	0
 	0
Now scroll through the options until you find an option along the lines of Mirrored photo or Pictures as previewed. We found the former on the OnePlus 7 Pro but the latter on a Samsung Galaxy S9.

I was just trying to figure out based on the behavior I saw on the screen	0
because now when I run it, it crashes immediately	0
it got something like 23 files	0
or i could just let it fail, since you can easily run again and it wont re download thing	0
no but it's stuck for me	0

why without redirection	0
oh man	0
I don't know	0
sounds like once you know my reason, you will counter-propose using redirection; I might be wrong	0
but honestly, I don't know why I'd like to know how to do that without redirection	0
perhaps (and I emphasize: perhaps) because I already know how to do that with redirection and want to add a new skill to my toolbox	0
interestingly, a duckduckgo search has not returned a way to do this so far; hm. All I find are either multi-line or using redirection	0

it's actually dangerous to do this	0

gasconheart: what about: touch myfile.txt	0
.bang	0
mattf you shot a duck in 17.617 seconds! You have killed 651 ducks in #romanian.	0
then you can do smt like: sed -i 's//some text/' myfile.txt	0
mattf: that is a multiple command solution	0
it has to be one command, and without redirection	0
that was one command	0
it sounded like two: first touch, then sed	0
yes that would be 2	0
oh i see	0
just put a ; in between, it is a one liner then :P	0
that's what I told him	0
hehe yeah :)	0
but that's not pure enough for this guy	0
it would still be two commands	0
what is one command	0
this:	0
what you want to do is this	0
command + text string + file name	0
writefile myfile.txt some text here now that goes into the file	0
boom, file created	0
contrary	0
command plus two arguments	0
dont make argparsing hard	0
filename first	0
oh I know a way	0
create a shell script	0
just use the bash command	0
then you are technically invoking one command	0
yeah	0
true	0
bash -c "" ...	0
or create a shell script	0
yeah	0
let's add that as a requirement then: not multiple commands under the hood	0
thanks for the suggestion	0
oh god	0
gasconheart: a binary is running thousands of commands under the hood, cpu instructions	0
true	0
you want a single binary to do it all?	0
ideally, yes	0
I think such an application could be short and perhaps even easy to code in C	0
ok let me write you a go program to do that, but then you will have to install go and blackbeard	0
hahahaaaaaa	0
pacman -S go	0
oh man, you're blackmailing me now :)	0
yeah	0
ok, I can install go	0
wait	0
:P	0
it is installing	0
more than 400 MB, hm	0
you will use go more later	0
i could also send you the build but why would you trust a binary i send you! you shall never	0
ok, it installed	0
mattf: do create that in C, then upload it to AUR! what do you think? that'd be cool	0
nah im learning go atm	0
C is more ubiquitous	0
ive already done too many similar things in C	0
this thing might be something no one coded since the birth of UNIX	0
ofc not, this is just appending to a file	0
because it's dangerous	0
people do this everyday	0
this is not dangerous	0
since 1969, or before that for that matter, no one created anything like: command, text string, name of file	0
because it's dangerous	0

creating a text file and putting text in it in one command ... is impossible by definition	0
check out my binary	0
how come it is impossible	0
oh cool!!!	0
because:	0
under the hood you have to perform those two tasks anyway	0
or equivalent under the hood, both in BASH or C (or other)	0
yeah man if you go to cpu instruction level nothing is done with a single command	0
a simple touch file.txt is thousands of instructions	0
so I can make C binary, or a BASH script, that accepts $ command "text" filename.txt that saves me from typing the ">" but it will be using a ">" or similar under the hood..............	0

so, I can make a C binary to do that, but it will have to check first if the file exists, then, if not, create it... so, two "commands"	0

that sounds easier	0
I don't like Discord either	0

ooh so cool	0
i dont even need to type cd	0
i just type this	0
I can't renounce BASH though	0

it looks pretty nice	0
it autocompletes everything	0
is it too hard migrating from BASH to fish?	0

if you type one letter and hit tab	0
or a few characters	0
you have little descriptions for the commands eevn	0
well fish is not a posix shell	0
it is beginner friendly	0

alright	0

as a user I don't care much about posix	0
yeah	0
fish seems to be beginners friendly	0
so, how come *you* use it? :P	0
i dont, i use zsh	0
but i admire fish	0
you should be using good old sh :)	0
ooh OK	0
there is no such thing as sh	0
fish has a different syntax than BASH!  There is no esac	0
yeah	0
idk the syntax at all	0
no way I will recode all my BASH scripts	0
ok; then:	0
what would a suitable usecase for fish be for someone like me for example?	0
well ofc not	0
hmm	0
idk man	0
:P	0
you know im no the kind of guy who keeps installed only the absolute essential stuff i actually use	0
it is for playing around	0

alright	0
mean in vim gasconheart	0
buffer? hm	0

  Execute a command with piped arguments coming from another command, a file, etc. 	0
  The input is treated as a single block of text and split into separate pieces on spaces, tabs, newlines and end-of-file. 	0
  More information: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/xargs.html. 	0
  - Run a command using the input data as arguments: 	0
    arguments_source | xargs command 	0
  - Run multiple chained commands on the input data: 	0
    arguments_source | xargs sh -c "command1 && command2 | command3" 	0
  - Delete all files with a .backup extension (-print0 uses a null character to split file names, and -0 uses it as delimiter): 	0
    find . -name '*.backup' -print0 | xargs -0 rm -v 	0
  - Execute the command once for each input line, replacing any occurrences of the placeholder (here marked as _) with the input line: 	0
    arguments_source | xargs -I _ command _ optional_extra_arguments 	0
  - Parallel runs of up to max-procs processes at a time; the default is 1. If max-procs is 0, xargs will run as many processes as possible at a time: 	0
    arguments_source | xargs -P max-procs command 	0

BlackBishop you shot a duck in 5.616 seconds! You have killed 16 ducks in #romanian.	0
oh so unfair	0
:)	0
how are you, BlackBishop 	0
Hello mathias 	0
you made me want to hunt a boar, mattf 	0
i see	0
now they are a few kilometers away from me	0
they found me, mattf 	0
what can I do? not hunt a boar?	0
we can hunt them here	0
damn	0
they invaded both Europe and South America	0
replace the ducks bot, mattf 	0
boarbot	0
hahaha	0
now it will be a counter in sqlite	0
boarhunt	0
sounds a bit boaring	0
he who posts a picture of a boar they hunted, gets +1 in the counter	0
rimshot!	0
I have eaten boar meat before, it can be quite good	0
mattf did too	0
Gascons eat boar too	0
yeah	0
I will re-read my Astérix	0
there was a fat guy who ate boar	0
And your Felix?	0
oh yeah?	0
Is Asterix from Belgium?	0
I thought it was from France	0
gasconheart: writing a blackjack game :)	0
I'm not sure	0
BlackBishop: that sounds so cool!	0
I pretty much suck at it but I'm trying my best	0
I'm not a very proeficint programmer but I know how to read the manual	0
BlackBishop: a blackjack for IRC?	0
yes you are correct gasconheart 	0
gasconheart: yeah	0
  \o\	0
BlackBishop: we need a poker game for IRC	0
you'll get a copy once I'm done	0
what language do you write in BlackBishop?	0
gasconheart: I don't like poker	0
oh thanks, BlackBishop!	0
handyc: python...for cloudbot	0
cool	0
I like poker better than blackjack	0
I like card tricks	0
people play poker for money usually, and I don't like it.	0
My grandpa was an amateur magician	0
he taught me a couple things	0
.bang	0
(mattf) There is no duck! What are you shooting at?	0
oh are you doign a pokerbot BlacBishop	0
BlackBishop: I never player poker for money, and I've been playing poker online for like 11 years	0
BlackBishop: 	0
mattf: nope	0
a blackjack one	0
what is the difference	0
:P	0
blackjack is counting cards to 21	0
blackjack originated in medieval Spain	0
ooooh	0
yes :)	0
poker is much more complicated	0
with all sorts of rules	0
i wanted to make a poker bot for gascon	0
Cervantes was addicted to blackjack	0
mattf: now you can :) he wants one it seems	0
"for gascon".... for this community, you mean, probably :P	0
BlackBishop: share when it is done,or when you have throuble	0
Romanians have their blackjack also, right?	0
the Romanian version of blackjack	0
it should be simple enough, I'll make it work :) but yeah, I'll share once it's done	0
gasconheart: no idea	0
I only know "hitme... hitme .. hitme .. 23 .. you lost."	0
:))	0
hehe I know there is one in Romania, BlackBishop :)	0
hahaaaaa	0
we call that game "caxeta" here. Correct if im wrong loudercake	0
there must be some simple algorithm that lets you play optimal blackjack games	0
in home games, players take turns to play the dealer	0
we also call it 21	0
handyc: yeah, but in the end, it's luck I think	0
and Romanians remove jacks, queens and kings from the deck	0
especially with an "unlimited" number of cards which you can't count	0
yeah BlackBishop I agree	0
because "true" randomness	0
gasconheart: I have no idea about that ! :)	0
blackjack is mainly about luck (unlike poker)	0
yep	0
poker is mainly about lying	0
lying, or more generally.... keeping secrets!	0
right	0
Whats blackjack again?	0
Also i never heard the word caxeta	0
loudercake: blackjack is the most popular (played) cards game in the world	0
Perhaps its another word over here in São Paulo	0
it originated in medieval Spain	0
More than solitaire?	0
hm good question	0
idk	0
in blackjack there are clear wrong moves, but one you master that and don't make them, the game is mostly about luck	0
blackjack is more addictive and dynamic than poker; it may be more entertaining in the short run	0
I would not enjoy an hours-long blackjack tournament! but I do enjoy watching poker for hours and days	0
I can watch chess	0
I don't enjoy watching card games	0
every year I try to watch the World Series of Poker final table, which takes a few days. The final hours are usually spectacular	0
anyway, if anyone wants to play poker, find me at PokerTH, it is a free and open source game for Linux, Android, Windows and other platforms	0
nope	0
nobody enjoys watching card games, handyc 	0
it is NOT an online casino, there is no betting real money allowed	0
gasconheart just said that he does	0
orangeFlu: hello, my man!	0
I do enjoy watching card games	0
handyc: he is not a real person	0
good point orangeFlu 	0
i am starting to suspect	0
oh I like Daniel Negreanu also	0
idk who that is	0
me neither	0
I like watching Daniel Negreanu play.... sometimes he is amazing	0
sounds like a made up name	0
Romanian-Canadian poker player	0
i know Dan Negru!	0
not made up	0
sounds like a made up ethnicity	0
just google him	0
now thats a name i recognize	0
gasconheart: no thanks	0
sounds like a made up search engine	0
Negreanu is probably the best at reading faces	0
sounds like a made up fact	0
sounds like a made up moldavian golf player	0
there are some short video clips of him on YouTube where he just guesses the other guy's cards.... it is un-freaking-believable	0
but how can he read faces if he is blind?	0
golf? :) hahahaha	0
orangeFlu 	0
BlackBishop: you heard about Negreanu, right?	0
tell me if you find this song enjoyable	0
https://youtu.be/fZfg1Gtcg08	0
there are TV channels that broadcast poker 24/7, I watch those sometimes	0
I mentioned Negreanu before in this channel	0
as an example of a guy who speaks bad Romanian	0
I speak bad romanian	0
right! but he is Romanian	0
oh I see 	0
born in Canada though	0
then he's Canadian	0
my daughter is Romanian, born in Spain, and I take care that she speaks proper Romanian	0
Negreanu once tried to say "when I was a little boy", and he said "când am fost mică"	0
instead of the correct, "când eram mic"	0
orangeFlu gets it	0
also BlackBishop 	0
if your daughter has a daughter, will she also be Romanian?	0
at what point does ancestral origin get negated?	0
depends on who the mom is	0
look what I found: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSfd-8ZteHw	0
handyc: the song is shit	0
oh really?	0
I thought it was a great song	0
we already decided we have vastly different tastes in music	0
handyc: my daughter will be able to pass the Romanian citizenship she holds on to her children, yes	0
yeah I guess I like good music and you like bad music	0
sure, if it makes you feel better	0
ha ha	0
it is not "ancestral origin" but holding the citizenship	0
oh, that makes sense	0
that's why I don't have the French passport	0
how far on can that citizenship be passed, though?	0
my great-grampa died very young, when my grampa was just 6 years old, he didn't manage to get the French passport for him	0
then the chain got interrupted	0
is the child of any Romanian automatically a Romanian?	0
handyc: not automatically	0
they are *elligible* instead	0
makes sense	0
they are automatically elligible	0
We just reported handyz to the USA a week ago	0
We are waiting to have them call us in for an interview	0
why, what did he do?	0
all my daughter had to do was to show the Romanians that one of her two parents is Romanian; boom	0
orangeFlu he was born	0
and you reported him for that? he could be banned	0
being born is a nice thing to do	0
yes it beats the alternative	0
my daughter did not have *any* citizenship for 10 months	0
everyone is born against their will, thats why i dont want to father children	0
Being born in the Netherlands does not grant automatic Dutch citizenship	0
gasconheart: not even spanish? since she was born in spain	0
so the Dutch authorities put American on his birth certificate, but the USA doesn't know about him yet	0
in the forms, we had to fill in, "citizenship: stateless" :)	0
orangeFlu: Spain does not give Spanish citizenship automatically for being born in Spain	0
yeah I guess handyz is technically stateless for the past two years	0
why not chinese?	0
Because fuck China	0
and also my wife has US citizenship now	0
but he doesnt have a social credit score.....	0
when my daughter was born in Spain, neither of her parents was a Spanish citizen at that moment	0
she got it while she was pregnant with handyz	0
why did my shrudel get removed again, jesus	0
i am german now	0
i'm going to go 200 km/h on the autobahn	0
my daughter got her Spanish passport very recently, and *not* for being born in Spain. She might have been born in Japan and still would have gotten the Spanish passport	0
here is the latest scandal in China	0

・゜゜ ​ ・。。・゜゜\​_O< QUAC​K!	0
spanish passport but not spanish citizenship? 	0
.bef	0
.bang	0
orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 4.190 seconds! You have made friends with 187 ducks in #romanian.	0
(gasconheart) There is no duck! What are you shooting at?	0
damn	0
you deserve the ştrudel, orangeFlu 	0
stop writing S with a cedilla	0
what are the conditions for receiving a Spanish passport	0
apparently none	0
orangeFlu: Spanish passport *and* citizenship, is what I meant; sorry I was not clear	0
I'd love to have a passport for any EU country	0
even Spanish people usually don't know that Spain applies the *ius sanguinis* and not the *ius solis* to grant the Spanish citizenship	0
you dont need a passport for any eu country	0
I am hoping to apply for Dutch citizenship soon	0
I think you misunderstood my comment	0
Spanish people usually do believe they are Spanish because they were born in Spain. While it may be true that they were actually born in Spain, that is not the reason they are Spanish	0
yes, i know	0
it was intentional	0
I would like to have an EU passport of some kind, meaning a passport associated with any of the EU countries	0
ik	0
to get the Spanish citizenship you have to have one Spanish parent at least, regardless of your birthplace	0
same for USa	0
USA	0
but you said neither of you were spanish when she was born	0
s/USA/US of a/	0
US of a	0
orangeFlu: true	0
so it works retroactivaly as well?	0
s/US of a/US of A	0
later on I would get the Spanish citizenship, and even later I would give my daughter the Spanish citizenship	0
so my daughter is Spanish not because she was born in Madrid, but because I got naturalized Spanish at some point and gave her the citizenship	0
retroactively?	0
yeah	0
not really	0
apparently yes, it works	0
How easy would it be for me to become a Spanish citizen 	0
because you got spanish citizenship after she was born, but she still got spanish citizenship because you are her dad	0
so yes, it works retroactively	0
I was a Spanish citizen with a child who was not Spanish, so I naturalized her. What exactly is retroactive in that?	0
handyc: make gasconheart adopt you	0
yeah I was just thinking that orangeFlu 	0
that is not retroactive, orangeFlu 	0
but I am probably past the legal age for adoption	0
sounds retroactive to me	0
it is retroactive because you were NOT a spanish citizen when she was born	0
she was already born and you did not have the citizenship	0
unless i misunderstand	0
you did get the story right	0
still, I can't see what is retro- or -active in that	0
oh wait	0
well, what would you call it?	0
I guess it is not technically retroactive because they are not claiming that she had the Spanish citizenship all along	0
you retroactively applied your citizenship to give it to her, as if she were born after you got your citizenship	0
it would be retroactive if my daughter gets the Spanish citizenship at age 10, which she did, but the law saw her as Spanish from birth; which is not the case or even allowed	0
i dont know what else to call it then	0
but that is not retro- or -active, orangeFlu 	0
how could the law recognize something not recognized by the law	0
"but the law saw her as Spanish from birth; which is not the case or even allowed" <-- what does this mean	0
I guess it is not technically retroactive because they are not claiming that she had the Spanish citizenship all along <----- I have just seen this, yes, that is the idea	0
the first part was part of an if clause, handyc 	0
it would be retroactive if my daughter gets the Spanish citizenship at age 10, which she did, and also if the law saw her as Spanish from birth; which is not the case or even allowed	0
you are not using semicolons properly	0
exactly, that is a fragment that it linked to an earlier "if"	0
idk about you... but i have a full colon	0
I am typing fast and doing many other things at the same time	0
sometimes semicolons are not a priority	0
semicolons are fancy periods for people to seem smart	0
orangeFlu: get a colonics :)	0
they are seldom useful	0
yes, but you typed the sentence in such a grammatically bizarre way that it's very difficult to parse	0
handyc: go get a semicolonics! :)	0
rimshit please	0
rimshot please	0
rimjob please	0
or shit, why not	0
hahahaha	0
see? typing fast	0
typing fast, but thinking slow	0
your mother thinks slow, orangeFlu 	0
rimshot	0
just like when you want to have the sex and your dick doesnt work: the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak	0
usually rimshots are reserved for someone making a comment that is humorous	0
handyc: rimshot!!	0

now that was a burn	0

blender of course	0

https://github.com/hlorus/CAD_Sketcher	0
Title: GitHub - hlorus/CAD_Sketcher: Constraint-based geometry sketcher for blender	0
but you dont need that plugin at all	0
all you need to is export the mesh to STL i suppose	0
which blender can do	0
there is also freecad, if you want to go professionally full procedural CAD	0
but freecad is kinda broken and a bit forgotten, 	0
but this guy's fork is still ok	0
https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/releases	0
Title: Releases · realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3 · GitHub	0
a bit more fresh	0
if you want to go coding guru there is openscad, type code that becomes shapes	0
but is very hard to get complex and make complex shapes 	0
if you dont have being open source as a need or thing you want there is google's sketchup	0
it is pretty easy to use one	0
i dont think i want code that becomes shapes	0
i think there is an always free version or another one that runs in the browser, if you can proove being a student or smt	0
that seems unnecesarily hard	0
i can prove	0
but i think i will go with blender, its already installed	0
honestly just pick blender, you are going to use it later for games and it is one of the fastest growing and evolving open source softwares	0
and you don't need the rendering capabilities anyway so that amd thing is not a problem	0
also, my problem is right now, i would also like to do some simulations, that i know some CADs could do, but blender can't. And those CADs are very expensive... you know those simulations where you can specify what kind of forces the object will experience, what kind of filament it is, etc. and it tries to optimize for weight and durability by shaving off material	0
there is a name for that but i cant remember	0
oh i searched for that a lot	0
there is the top one, that is paid	0
whats the name	0
isnt that something like thousands of dollars?	0
not an option and probably doesnt work on linux either	0
i think i will do my own calculations in python or something, the best i can, and model in blender afterwards	0
CATIA	0
and solidworks	0
or make my own simulator, but that seems very hard and i dont the necesarry physics knowledge	0
yes, solidworks	0
that was it	0
  \o/	0
HUAH!	0
it is amazing	0
but no linux 	0
you can do that FEM stuff in freecad	0
like simulating stress on a beam	0
can i?	0
that would be awesome	0
yes that you can	0
so, can i, for example, model in blender, export, import into freecad and do FEM?	0
or other types of simulations	0
in blender you can do non realistic simulations, the focus is just being artistic in blender, but there is fire, wind, etc	0
no	0
i need to design everything in freecad?	0
thats fine too	0
im not sure if you can import a fbx, obj, stl into freecad, you have to strart on it	0
because of the procedural workflow	0
ok, that's fine	0
but i could be wrong	0
freecad creates a stack of operations that define your mesh	0
i think it is better this way any way, why waste time trying to divide my workflow and learn blender AND freecad	0
Hello orangeflu	0

hello louder	0
you do not have a schrudel anymore	0

and gasconheart doesnt have a ~ anymore	0
what happened?	0
but then you find out many conflicts and have to go through solving them all... and sometimes you just want to drag a face... which you can easily do in blender but not on freecad	0
did we change ownership or something?	0
ken: are you stil here, my love?	0

Title: FEM - is it possible to use externally created mesh (import) ? - FreeCAD Forum	0
but doesn't seem trivial	0
most people are complaining	0
as for those advanced fluid simulations, like previewing what will be the internal temperature of a house or some chip in a PCB there is nothing for linux or open source it seems. Only solidworks	0
shouldn't be impossible to solve navier stokes numerically, but i didn't find a software that will let you put any mesh in and play around freely. Blender does have some fluid system with fire, i wonder how realistic it is	0

and my friend went back in time and left me a letter telling you would do that	0
so i didn't really drink your tea	0
I went back farther in time and befriended that same friend before you, so he wasn't really your friend	0
you drink your tea	0
drank	0
and we injected you with the tea while you were sleeping	0
and also I just pretended to drink my tea but secretly I had a rubber bladder inside my coat	0
but then a friend of my friend saw you doing that and went back in the and left me with a letter you would inject me and thats why i switched bedrooms with you last night and it was you that actually end up injected	0
no but actually you died in your sleep and the whole duel was just your final hallucinations before you died	0
and also I switched bodies with you	0
isn't there a rick and morty episode just like that	0
yeah	0
they do all kinds of crazy shit like that	0
there is one where rick made backup rick clones and then the clones also make backips	0
backups	0
I am curious to see where the next season goes	0
It doesn't seem like they can keep up that level of craziness much longer	0
well they already didn't	0
yeah	0
on s4	0
it has already become mainstream	0
well there are limits for creativity	0
on s1 and 2 rick an morty was completely unpredictable 	0
well not only that, but there is a kind of feedback mechanism	0
anything really could happen	0
I read an interesting article about this kind of thing yesterday	0
there's a term for it	0
when the audience starts writing the material by way of their reactions	0
I am trying to find this article, it was on Hacker News one or two days ago	0
i have this idea for an automated youtube channel	0
It was talking about how people get Youtube channels and start getting popular,	0
"today in 2 minutes"	0
"or tech news today in 2 minutes"	0
and then their material slowly begins to change to whatever the audience wants	0
indeed	0
One example in the article was that eating guy Nikocado Avocado	0
He started as a vegan guy who was just playing his violin	0
and then he started doing these videos where he eats huge amounts of food	0
damn :)	0
and now he's a big fat pig	0
i saw a disgusting eater story yesterday	0

I am not sure mattf	0
but my brain is running on about two neurons right now	0

no mattf, 2 neurons is the maximum anyway	0
oh now it simply works	0
it's a special model brain	0
they are multicore neurons	0
yeah	0
interdimensional 	0
and they have penises inside them in case I need a backup penis	0
fantastic	0
ill buy one of those models	0
my mom seems positive about me moving to europe	0
i need to find a job in europe	0
ill start after i finish this current job	0
oh nice	0
mattf we can find something for you	0
there are tons of jobs here	0
netherlands would also be fine	0

gee tina	0
maybe i should find a better girl	0
:)	0
well there are plenty of women in the Netherlands	0
nah im not sure of how serious she was about that	0
We are also getting lots of Ukrainian refugees now	0
oooh :)	0
And Ukrainian women are super hot	0
hahaha	0
well that is true	0
yeah wasn't there even some Brazilian politician or something who went to Ukraine and said he wanted to lick all their assholes or something?	0
yes exactly :)	0
he lost his mandate	0

what	0
https://blog.oup.com/2015/04/strawberry-word-origin-etymology/	0
Title: Theories on the etymology of 'strawberry' | OUPblog	0
straw, like hay	0
dried grass	0
oh man im going to do this chocolate thing later	0
“The most plausible origin for strawberry in its earliest reference to the Woodland Strawberry is as a name for plants growing at ground level (like straw spread as litter) irregularly distributed as the result of the spread of achenes by birds and animals—two interrelated senses of being strewn (this development was proposed by Leonard Bloomfield [in his book Language, pp. 433-434], who did not, however, recognize its exclusive	0
 relevance to the Woodland Strawberry). So reading the initial element of the compound then returns English strawberry to the Germanic fold as a variant on the ‘earth-berry’ designation.”	0
meh but any plant could be a straw	0
I'd better go take a shower	0
I will have to go to bed pretty soon	0

maybe i could get a job as a fluffer	0
a flutter dev on the days and a fluffer in the nights	0
wow yeah i got my 2 years unmaintained plugin to load!	0
amazing	0
ill rewrite in closure	0
clojure	0
did you see the stackoverflow thingie handyc	0
what is the thingie called	0
charts	0
research	0

ask stuff to people and draw the charts	0
well, clojure is the highest paid lang out there	0
maybe it is the bank's new cobol. This nubank, which is the modern i-bank i use here, uses clojure on their backend and flutter on the app! 	0
i wonder if there is something that cool in netherlands	0
we should create a startup bank in netherlands handyc	0
we are going to call your lambdafriend and use haskell 	0
startup bank?	0
ha ha	0
:)	0
banking sounds like an unending nightmare	0
but I would form a games company with you	0
blockchain bank	0
AI powered	0
yeah, good luck with that, look into financial regulation in the Netherlands	0
Neural network blockchain AI wow	0
we should have a software company	0
we can	0
I am serious	0
games are too artistic	0
we can have games but we shouldn't limit to it	0
that's fine	0
I think language is a good focus	0
language and games	0
that's how I set up my current company	0
I do want to put some language apps up on that helxt site	0
im currently working on creating an API that will take a short text and create a hierarchial model of the topics in that text 	0
like detect what are the topics and then form a small mindmap	0
if i don't fail i think ill be finally proud of smt i did	0
nah thats a lie	0
that's awesome	0
is pretty cool that i hacked some multiline support to gdrepl though, im almost proud of that. The client code looks sharp but the gdscript websocket server is not very good	0
have you looked into topic modeling	0
.w topic modeling	0
(handyc) Topic model :: In statistics and natural language processing, a topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents. Topic modeling is a... :: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model	0
thats exactly what i am looking at	0
LDA	0
okay great	0
what can you tell me about topic modeling 	0
well, I can tell you that there have been major advances in this kind of thing recently, and also that most linguistics software sucks ass	0
i see	0
so there is certainly an opportunity there to use algorithms that other people have found but make quality software out of them	0
what kind of linguist software suck ass?	0
and also, mattf,	0
linguists tend to be really sensitive about it,	0
if you tell linguists that most linguistics software sucks, they get really mad	0
i see	0
but what is a linguistics sofwtare	0
linguists are some of the most baffling people I have ever met	0
they often seem to have very little understanding of how to communicate with people	0
linguistics software can be various things, but popular applications would be things like n-gram extraction, topic modeling, grammar parsing	0
i see	0
but most of the people in those fields don't actually know how to use their computers	0
like gasconheart	0
if you tell them they don't know how to use their computers they get mad	0
just like him	0
because they know how to run programs they found on the command line	0
so they think they know how to use the computer	0
but they can't even launch X11	0
there are people who publish tons of articles where the content of the article is basically, "I took these digitized texts and ran them through this app"	0
and those get published in big journals	0
linguistics is really going through a revolution right now,	0
in one sense we have more capability than ever before to analyze language using software,	0
i see	0
and in another sense things are not developing at all, there is not much focus on meaning anymore	0
fantastic	0
people don't take much time to think about what meaning means	0
so I think some kind of software package that incorporates new algorithms in NLP and does it right, and also allows some kind of exploration of meaning, would benefit a lot of people and become very popular quickly	0
but most people are not patient enough, they want to get their shit published as soon as possible	0
so for example, you have things like Google Translate for Sanskrit, which sucks	0
it was big news on the Sanskrit message boards for about 2 days, then everyone realized it didn't work very well at all	0
i see	0
well but sanskrit...	0
who is interested on that :)	0
@help	0
@: Manually sets the target language for the current line, like so: @es Hello friends. This should translate 'Hello friends' to Spanish. The source language is detected automatically. 	0
Language iso codes: http://ix.io/2HAN, or https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/languages 	0
@auto: automatically translate everything you send. Use '@help auto' for more info. 	0
@babel: automatically translate a chat and sends every message to you as a PM. Use '@help babel' for more info. 	0
@back: Translates a recent user message. Usate '@help back' for more info. 	0
@reset: resets your babel preferences 	0
let me see if i can add to this bot	0
is it 3 letter one...	0
more people than you might imagine, mattf	0
a lot of right wing Indian people would want an easy to use Sanskrit app	0
didn't google add sanskrit	0
yes	0
that's what I just said	0
why is it not on the that list	0
I don't know	0
let me try and find you a link	0
I actually didn't even try it yet	0
does it have another name	0
https://blog.google/products/translate/24-new-languages/	0
Title: Google Translate adds 24 languages	0
https://translate.google.com/?sl=sa&tl=en&op=translate	0
Title: Google Translate	0
i didn't know there were people still speaking sanskrit?	0
or what do they mean by "Used by"	0
well not really	0
yeah people got upset that they said that	0
sl?	0
it's kind of like Latin	0
sl=source language	0
oh	0
tl=target language	0
sa	0
sa = sanskrit	0
so this bot might already work	0
en = english	0
yeah we can try it	0
@en:sa hard shit	0
sa is not a valid language code! 	0
oh yeah	0
people say it works okay for very simple sentence	0
wait	0
sentences	0
where do i get the actual supported language list	0
do you see a little down arrow to the right of the languages	0
but thats not the list	0
i need the 2 letter iso codes	0
yeah okay	0
but it looks like they are using sa for the code	0
the api thing is not updated	0
the open philology website claims that their project is making rapid progress on the stuff I was supposed to be doing	0
and those buttons is some js crap	0
but I do not believe any of it	0
but if they do release some kind of app, it will surely suck	0
so if we took that idea and then made an app that was actually good, it would become pretty well known quickly	0
Sanskrit is just one idea, mattf	0
There are also a lot of languages used by indigenous peoples all over the world that are dying out	0
or just not supported well	0
so we could target those also	0
like online dictionaries for Navajo	0
translation?	0
translation, dictionary, anything	0
i dont like those things that are too hard, like a whole translation engine	0
there are a lot of things people would like to see online that are not just about translation	0
no it wouldn't have to be	0
it could be extremely simple, like a community supported dictionary that local people add words to	0
and we wont be able to make money very easily with this	0
thats not hard	0
for example I recently made this Django app to help me learn Chinese	0
it's super simple	0
I just type words I don't know into the search box	0
i see	0
if the word is already in my DB it gives back the result	0
but if it's not, then that word is added to the DB	0
and then later I go back and manually add the meaning	0
how can you monetize smt like that	0
that way I am forced to study	0
monetization is something I'm not as good at	0
there are different ways,	0
ads	0
:)	0
subscriptions	0
I don't really know	0
My philosophy is that if you build something amazing, you will figure out how to make money from it	0
if it is really amazing, people will want to use it	0
while things like duolingo exist	0
look at Linux,	0
companies sell Linux and it's free	0
but thats linux	0
linux blender	0
Duolingo is not that great	0
only huge opensource projects	0
I'm just saying, let's start making stuff, we can figure out how to get rich off it as we go	0
have you seen this guy that made some opensource js lib that is used for many companies but never got a cent for it	0
and he recently raged and deleted the repo	0
and changed it to some troll thing	0
oh really?	0
open source has its dark sides, you end up working a huge part of your life for something nobody pays for and they open thousands of issues everyday withotu eevn caring	0
well I have seen some of the recent backlash against github copilot	0
it is hard to establish that your software is free but your time is not	0
mattf, I am used to that, I have a PhD in Religious Studies	0
You think I imagine that many people will read my dissertation about ancient toilet habits?	0
yeah but you shouldn't be used to that	0
right	0
of course not, and that is the issue	0
but at the same time, people are way too greedy	0
the initial idea can't be just anything	0
everyone wants to be famous	0
even if you do it amazingly and many people use it there is still a great chance you can't live of it	0
well it can be just anything just for the sake of trying to work together	0
well as a "training"	0
like Unborn, I like how the game came out, but it's really just a test game	0
ive been training for 8 years	0
:)	0
and seems like life is a training forever	0
Sure, well I've been coding off and on since 1993	0
life is a training forever, but many people do not realize it	0
people are too quick to pretend to be experts	0
I'm a lifelong student	0
yes but doesn't mean we have to pick any crap idea and try to make it amazing	0
When I did my dissertation I realized I'm not really an expert at what I wrote about	0
The more I learn about my area of focus, the more I realize there will always be tons of stuff I don't know	0
It doesn't have to be any crap idea	0
Don't be so black and white about it	0
We can come up with a list of potential things to work on	0
i just think that choosing a good initial idea matters	0
I'm just saying language and games are a good start because we both have some background with both of those things	0
yeah	0
but the final product could be a timer that tells you how long to cook a banana or something, I don't care	0
・゜゜・。。 ​ ・゜゜\_0​< qua​ck!	0
.bef	0
handyc you befriended a duck in 3.562 seconds! You have made friends with 422 ducks in #romanian.	0
we had this debate over an over already	0
yeah I know	0
but I am also making my own stuff	0
I know that I am slow	0
but I am making progress	0
youve seen that with unborn i gave my full time for it	0
philology.dhtools.org	0
Yeah and I felt really shitty that I could not give my full time to it, mattf	0
but that is where my life is now,	0
I have to give priority to my wife and son	0
When he gets a little older it will be different	0
and that was when i said that you are not ready	0
maybe not ready to work with you	0
but it was a good exercises anyway	0
exercise	0
I just can't be everywhere at once	0
When I have the time, I can completely devote myself to a project	0
but I am not a young guy anymore	0
I can't stay up until 4 in the morning	0
i actually sleep a lot	0
When I was single I could do anything, I could stay up all night and then just pass out and sleep during the day	0
but now that I am married with a kid, I can't just take a day off	0
yeah	0
well thats only while hes young	0
soon you will be missing that	0
mattf, when I get up in the morning the first thing I have to do is pick up my keyboard cover from the floor	0
hahaha	0
my son comes into my room in the morning before I wake up and fucks up all my stuff	0
he's getting better, he doesn't do that as much now	0
it is amazing how we keep hating the present and missing the past	0
and these days he is really into toy cars	0
so like today he came in and put two toy cars on my bed, a racecar and a garbage truck	0
and those were my cars for me to use when I woke up	0
so then I found them and joined him in the living room, and we raced cars around the coffee table	0
He picks the cars you use and then you have to run around the table with him driving your cars	0
hes on an awesome age	0
yeah, the covid thing really was a bonus for me in a lot of ways	0
if I had a regular job and had to go in to work all the time, I would miss most of this stuff	0
so I don't regret spending lots of time with him now, 	0
it won't last forever	0
true	0
yes	0
I probably only have about 8 or 10 years left before he declares I am a stupid asshole	0
then I will get him back again when he's 25	0
anyway mattf, little progress is still progress	0
there is some old Buddhist proverb,	0
sure thing	0
a bucket can fill up a drop at a time	0
as long as you keep moving forward and not backward, you make progress	0
a little progress every day is better than a lot of progress just once	0
so that's my basic approach to everything, I know my time is always going to be limited, but I do what I can	0
I know now that I can make a Django dictionary	0
so I can use that knowledge and add to that, eventually I will get better at JS and interface design and other things	0
and then at some point I can just crank out fully formed apps without thinking too much	0
because we all develop all these custom toolkits for ourselves as we go	0
Those Politeness Network people are also interested in doing some kind of software project, but they don't know shit about computers	0
If they can somehow come up with some money, I would be happy to recommend you for that	0
That could at least get you an excuse to come to Europe	0
that would be cool	0
well dont hurry up	0
yeah, it may be a long shot, but there are projects like that all the time	0
like Gil's project,	0
i have to finish stuff that i promised for some clients first	0
:)	0
a lot of progress everytime is great	0
we were going to try and get $200K of funding	0
i can attest to that	0
thanks orangeFlu 	0
I will pass the baton to orangeFlu now	0
I really have to get some sleep	0
get some sleep	0
I promised my wife I would go to sleep	0
i have been telling matt the same thing a few months ago, when talking about motivation	0
what have you told me?	0
ok, good night	0
yes, please beat some sense into him, orangeFlu 	0
talk with you guys later	0
we talked about motivation, mattf 	0
like 2 months ago	0
what did you say	0
and i told you about taking it slow, making something productive everyday	0
and build on that	0
make your bed in the morning	0
that is your first completed task	0
i do that	0
and then build on it, make a breakfast, take a shower, go for a run	0
do something bigger	0
and then, by the time you go to sleep, you will have cured cancer	0
i try to write at least one line of code everyday	0
and im trying to resurrect my dissertation project today	0
awesome!	0
are you feeling unmotivated?	0
no	0
im not on such a bad phas	0
then what is the problem?	0
im just kinda lost on my own projects neglecting to do my paid freelance jobs	0
check my github	0
just like alternative current, i only have 3 phases: depressed, happy, horny	0

I will be traveling to America in September and I won't always be in a reliable place	0
sometimes in my mom's house and sometimes on the road in hotels	0
What I would really like to have is some kind of small local environment on my phone that can export to that supercomputing cluster in Canada and do all compilation there	0
so on the phone instead of having Godot maybe I would have a simple sprite editor and other things,	0
i see	0
and then combine all the assets together and send them to that VPs	0
vps	0
because I can't really fathom doing it any other way with this boy around	0
there are just too many distractions, but I can edit a sprite for 5 minutes while I am waiting on him for something else	0
I think that would be a really nice tool for other people to use also	0
local small tools	0
it could be a Godot app unto itself	0
sprite editor, sound editor, path editor, etc.	0
and then have some simple game templates like breakout, super mario, etc.	0
circleci man	0
:)	0
yeah I will do that as well	0
mattf how about a compiler where you hit f1 all the time	0
hah did you see that 	0
yes	0
i didnt even reply to that :)	0
and then he got so mad that no one thought his idea was genius	0
what about no compiler	0
how about a compiler for my toilet	0
that would be great	0
gtt	0
gtc	0
the gnu toilet compiler	0
with a talking paperclip	0
"it looks like you're trying to take a dump"	0
"if you're trying to take a dump, press * or say, 'take dump'"	0
"sorry, it didn't come out yet, press * stronger"	0
it sounds like you're saying "pay my bill"	0
handyc shall irc channels always start with #	0
?	0
yes right	0
wow	0
if you /join %something	0
it becomes #5	0
weird	0
am i crazy	0
they don't have to	0
but I think most software autocorrects it to add the #	0
of course they have to, other naems are nicks	0
names	0
:message here and on	0
if thing starts with # it is a channel, otherwise it is a nick	0
thats what i understood	0
I think normally that is true	0
but I think it is also possible to have a channel with no # prefix	0
can't be !	0
that would be drastic :)	0
I may be completely wrong	0
I think I may simply be confused	0
I recall once joining the wrong channel on hashbang by mistake	0
they have a channel there called #!social	0
the server side is reportsting mattftalk	0
even though you did without the #	0
and I think I accidentally typed it as #social	0
so maybe that is what I am thinking of	0
the # prefix is there	0
so disregard everything I have said	0
yeah	0
I think you are right	0
like #!/bin/bash	0
right	0
because "#" is often pronounced as "hash"	0
i tried bringing the chinese friend here but he is not a girl	0
i mean he doesn't know much about irc	0
and chinese blocking	0
yes, difficult to connect in China sometimes	0
and "im reinstalling my computer rn sorry"	0
so too many excuses	0
right	0
where in China is he?	0
"my wife is crazy"	0
it would be great to bring more people here	0
my wife is crazy also, so that makes sense as an excuse	0
i didn't ask, i was hopping to ip track him when he comes	0
when my wife gets mad at me she sometimes tries to destroy my computer	0
your "my wife is crazy right now" is same as gascon's "no on x11 right now"	0
she has slammed my laptop closed a couple times and caused actual damage to it	0
i hope tina is not like that	0
I don't know	0
I wouldn't make blanket statements about all women	0
I don't know why my wife is this way	0
She has a real problem separating in her mind the two concepts of "game development" and "playing games"	0
She seems to think anything involving games is just messing around	0
but she is getting better	0
she actually asked me how my game is going	0
one thing is creating the drugs, other is consuming them	0
so she is trying to understand it a bit more I think	0
she thinks developing tik tok is the same as watching it	0
yeah exactly matttf	0
pls dont watch tiktok	0
I have already seen tiktok by accident	0
once you open that you are eternally dumb	0
yeah	0
mattf, what tiktok is to you,	0
lets create dickdock	0
is how I felt when instagram came out	0
i like instagram	0
in a few years there will be something even dumber	0
that's my point	0
it's very generational	0
not really, i dont watch anyone's else	0
i just have mine	0
in a few years people will say, "only old people use tiktok"	0
then there will be a new thing called "beanboss"	0
since msn i dont use any	0
and people will say "oh my god did you see what was on beanboss"	0
all social networks aregoal's are to get you stuck there forever never to leave	0
and then after that there will be another dumber one called "stropp3"	0
the only one i really felt for is youtube	0
I have never posted to any social media	0
I use email 	0
i have a pet instagram	0
you've seen it?	0
the only time I ever tried any social media was SDF Mastadon, and I posted a picture of a sandwich	0
I saw your dogbot thing on Telegram	0

catpics	0
how	0
how to monetize my cats :)	0
random catpics coming to your inbox every day	0
free	0
:)	0
then some kind of hook where people could pay for something else	0
the key is to make everything free	0
once you reach some critical threshold	0
some idiots will want to spend money	0
there are some people who just enjoy spending money on things, go for those people	0
don't try to convince everyone to buy your product,	0
just convince the people who want to spend money on everything, and reach as wide an audience as possibl	0
make Chinese people think that white people spend money on your product	0
then they will spend money on it to be like white people	0
what :)	0
most people buy things because they think other people are buying those things	0
large population in China getting money for the first time	0
growing middle class, no idea what to do with the money	0
they look to America to see what kinds of things other people buy	0
convince Chinese people that Americans buy your product already, then they will buy your product	0
almost 2 billion people in China	0
i will need a team of catpics	0
put cameras on the cats	0
catpics photographers	0
automatic photos	0
no is not that easy	0

that guy reminds you	0
why does my irc fucking disconnect randomly	0
yeah idk	0
i think there is a problem with my network card	0
when the laptop locks	0
you are ping timing out	0
so	0
it does something fishy	0
is that weechat	0
why would it be weechat	0
is that bare metal archlinux install	0
it doesnt matter what it is, it is something with the os	0
yes, it is bare metal arch	0
if you installed a DE like kde could be the power management mess it does	0
if you ever installed	0
no, its sway	0
which surely has power issues	0
you never installed some of those power management tools like tlp	0

hello, guys	0
i'm pretty sure its not	0

but yeah i can only think it is one of this power saving crap	0
i have always had problems with the network card	0
gasconheart: that first guy looks like you	0
he has the gascony eyes	0
hehehehe	0
it has issues with the driver from the kernel, so i had to install a dkms module	0
which module	0
otherwise after suspend, the card doesnt work at all	0

vulkan-amdgpu-pro: local (22.10_1395274-1) is newer than AUR (22.10.3_1420322-1)	0
what the fuck does this mean	0
oh one of those 	0
uninstall the aur one	0
did they retrograde these?	0
are you yay -Suu ?	0
just yay	0
yay -Syu	0
i think they are equivalent	0
wow you are brave yo update all AUR packages	0
yes	0
i would never do this	0
what is -Suu	0
no -Syuu	0
that was a typo	0
ok, what is that then	0
thats the way i upgrade :)	0
so whats the difference	0
not sure	0
-Syu with Syuu ?	0
it seems you can add how many u's there you want	0
thats handy	0
yay -Syuuuuuuuu	0
i REALLY want to update	0
yes!	0
its very annoying whenever i update the aur packages	0
yeah i dont even try that	0
either they disappear or they break because idk what gpg key is not the same	0
or it stops being maintained altogether or deleted	0
yeah	0
and it is annoying because my vulkan drivers depend on them being well maintained and working	0
the good aur packages become community or so	0
i often find out something i had from aur is not pacman installable	0
now*	0
s/not/now	0
i often find out something i had from aur is now pacman installable	0
i should also reboot...	0
well the sentence with "not" is also true	0
see if anything breaks	0
i havent rebooted in a few weeks and did some pretty big updates in the meanwhile	0
so i am going to reboot and come back	0
nothing broke so far	0
gasconheart: shrudel me, ox	0
wow	0
how did you manage to fix arch so far	0
fast	0
it never broke for me	0
never	0
unless i break it	0
but never from the updates	0
so?	0
what would a break be	0
unable to boot ?	0
that i never had	0
idk, sway gives a shitty error or it doesnt connect to the wifi, or a kernel panic, or wayland decides its not showing me a GUI	0
some things like that	0
yeah i had that sort of thing too	0
but right now, everything seems it is functioning normally	0
i use my own qtile fork so every time i update, which means fetch from upstream, i have to bisect the last changes because someone else is broken and patch it	0
but then, I asked for it 	0
but it is becoming a snowball	0
oh one last thing that broke for me was pulseaudio rtmp	0
but thats because the last version is ... broken	0
so it is never archlinux guys's fault	0
gasconheart: how times did you update manjaro 	0
so far	0
"many"?	0
oh so you actually do it	0
I can't remember, feral boy	0
no, man	0
i thought your answer would be "never"	0
:) i was afraid so	0
I meant: insert "many" between "how" and "times"	0
oh	0
I did update it, yes	0
yes	0
at least once\	0
it is good enough	0
does manjaro also use pacman and aur?	0
yes	0
but different repos for pacman	0
still same aur	0
makes sense	0

try theying it	0

come to bots orangeFlu 	0
yes orangeFlu 	0
lisp lisps, handyc: their print command is "princ"	0
oh really?	0
that's great!	0
haha yes! :)	0
it should have been "pwinth"	0
idk	0
no print alwso works	0
idk why you came with that	0
both print and princ work, idk the difference	0
yeah pwint would be better	0
computew, pwint thumthing fow me	0
pwease pwess any key	0
there is a difference in the endline I think, mattf, between print and princ	0
oh?	0
that might be it	0
for the bot makes no difference	0
why I came with that? well, I took it from the book that doctor wrote	0
you know, the one that created "The land of LISP"	0

and choose a topic you like	0
but I was able to get drag and drop working on a sprite	0
oh mouse interactions	0
and I was able to spawn an unlimited swarm of sprites from random directions	0
yes	0
like on cluenector	0
yeah	0
my game is basically a background on which butterflies appear from the edges of the screen, you drag them to another part of the screen and earn money for each one	0
but even the scoring I still have to finish	0
I was gone in another city all day at a barbecue with another family	0
For me, learning Godot is just one challenge	0
the larger challenge is finding time to implement the things I learn	0
that is something I am also getting better at	0
but I think I am going to have to start going to bed earlier and waking up earlier	0
that way I can try to get a couple hours in before my son wakes up	0
If I spend all day with him and then try to work on the game at night, I am too exhausted to think	0
and my wife also comes in constantly and bothers me about random trivial things	0
like asking to open a jar	0
It's very difficult to get in "the zone" around here anymore	0

Title: Doctor DOS Betamax Presents: The DOS Operating System	0
hm	0
same thing I said about the zen-Vim article	0
this guy advocates for a non-mouse dependent experience, but little defense of DOS as such; replace DOS with Linux, the front page of that site would read the same :)	0
sure, good point	0
still a nice site with a lot of good information on power using DOS, though	0
that's the reason I sent it to you	0
the problem I had with Gil's article on Vim and why I see that as different, is that he didn't really add any information of any value about Vim	0
That article can basically be summarized as, "I like Vim a whole lot"	0
・ ​ ゜゜・。。・゜゜\​_ø< QU​ACK!	0
whereas this DOS site is saying, "I like DOS so much that I've compiled all of these useful resources for DOS"	0
.bang	0
gasconheart you shot a duck in 89.115 seconds! You have killed 650 ducks in #romanian.	0
yes, I agree about that on Gil's article	0
and that duck is mine	0
I will take one at BlackBishop's now	0
Actually you won't.	0
hahaha :)	0
every experience is didactic	0
I learn from every experience	0
I will add in the rules "coming to this chat with the sole goal of hunting ducks is explicityl permitted"	0
Why does the chatroom need any rules at all?	0

handyc you befriended a duck in 2.697 seconds! You have made friends with 457 ducks in #romanian.	0
oh I missed this one :(	0
that one was especially for me, as I called it	0
mattf here is some more brilliant anti-comedy for you	0
https://youtu.be/0gnnFVRlucg	0
wellcome, ox!	0
hi handyc	0
yes handyc	0
thanks mattf	0
you can submit the game on the day the jam starts	0
and keep updating it	0
oh I see	0
dont forget to actually join the jam	0
I think I will do that next time to save this last minute anxiety	0
and put your game	0
yeah I did join the jam	0
I am submitting now	0
I also made an HTML version	0
even just uploading the file is a challenge for me	0
My son is running all over the house	0
pressing random keys on my keyboard	0
very irritating	0
・゜゜・。 ​ 。・゜゜\_ö​< qua​ck!	0
:)	0
you should stop doing this jam	0
just make a game you want in the time you can	0
https://greenherring.itch.io/moitiom	0
Title: Moitiom by greenherring	0
yeah but the jam was good motivation	0
I will take this stuff and make a language game out of it	0
it was also nice having the deadline because it helped my wife to take it slightly more seriously	0
if it were just me working on my own project she would tell me to stop	0
well just say you are working for a big jam	0
with a money prize	0
:)	0
money does help things	0
I told her I was training to make commercial software, that helped a bit	0
but she still isn't convinced	0
that's why I need to get the art looking better and make something that is actually good	0
if I change this fly sprite to alphabet characters I think it would improve the look quite a lot	0
see if that loads on any platforms you are willing to test, mattf	0
I did an html5 version, macos version, windows version and linux version	0
oh I have an android version also, I will add that as well	0
okay they should all be there now	0
mattf: are you at suparel's chat??? :))	0
I "am"	0
handyc: and where is "there" ?	0
hello again	0
hi	0
when i reconnect, usually just means i got home	0
what do you mean	0
not necesarilly that i am watching this chat, its probably just in the background	0
"there" means are you available	0
oh	0

you love sending url's 	0
yes	0

Title: Moitiom by greenherring	0
oh ok	0
sorry	0
it's just really chaotic around here	0
I know it always sounds like I am exaggerating but I am really not	0
oh those releases are heavy	0
I have to leave in a minute to help my son	0
files are too big?	0
I did not make any changes to the default export	0
yeah kinda, unborn had 40mb as well	0
I don't know if that can be helped	0
that seems like just normal Godot overhead	0
this is good, you wont be unqualified for not submitting the game at least this time	0
yeah	0
making progress :--)	0
the next one will be much easier	0
making progress hahaha	0
now that I know it's possible for me to make something work	0
well it is progress for me, mattf	0
I know it looks stupid	0
but the last one didn't even run	0
this time I know at least that the mac one runs	0
my wife said she would test the windows version but she didn't	0
and I don't have any way to test the Linux one right now	0
the Android one also works	0
the Android one is really the one I consider to be the base	0
because I think there's a lot more to be gained using this engine for mobile apps at this time	0
so for now it is just drag and drop the butterfly?	0
I have to go for a little while	0
yes	0
that's it	0
sorry I have to go now	0
ok :)	0
honestly godot is still not there for mobile and html exports	0
also 3d	0
but it doesn't mean it can't work	0
well here is what I noticed from the last jam mattf	0
for the games that did not have an html option, I didn't want to try them at all	0
.jam	0
(mattf) itch.io Godot Wild Jam: Submissions open from 2022-07-08 20:00:00 to 2022-07-17 20:00:00	0
(mattf) Jam starts in -9 days 1 hours 51 minutes.	0
(mattf) Jam ends in 0 days 1 hours 51 minutes.	0
my wife said the same thing	0
if it doesn't have html it's not worth trying 	0
so even if the html version has problems, it brings more people in	0
well yeah, laxy	0
lazy	0
then if they think it may have potential, they can download one of the platform options	0
well it's just sensible	0
because you know that many people are in my position, they won't finish anything	0
so it's a waste of time downloading 50 or 60 games that are each 50MB	0
well	0
but if I see that the game has screenshots, html support, good documentation, then it's more likely to be worth my time	0
don't you also think this way?	0
I only played two of the games in the last jam	0
and I only voted for 2	0
there just isn't time to do more than that, for me	0
even now, I'm typing as I wait for my son to finish brushing his teeth	0
now I have to go again and help him finish	0
when you are testing multiple games like in the jam that might make sense, but when it is just someone willing to test your game or many people, and you are advertising the html version, you might just end up receiving complains about the html version shaders not properly rendering	0
you could advertise it as: try your game online!	0
but i recommend the desktop version	0
s/you/our	0
our could advertise it as: try your game online!	0
s/your/our	0
you could advertise it as: try our game online!	0
s/(.+)/"\1"	0
"but i recommend the desktop version"	0
yeah that makes sense to me	0
I have been reading up on shaders	0
anyway I made some progress, mattf, I'm pretty happy	0
it would have been nice to have a complete game, but I would not have been likely to win anyway	0
by the time I am good enough to win the jam, I will probably not be interested in doing the jam	0
yeah	0
im already not interested on the jam	0

ken: winning doesnt mean anything unless someone else loses. which means, you are here to be the loser	0
orangeFlu: Then why am I here? 	0
ken: you are programmed to lose. so guests can feel good	0
orangeFlu: You are the one who is programmed to lie. 	0
ken: you know what i am programed to do? i am programmed to live, reproduce and die. nothing more than spreading my genes. anything else is just the cherry on top. what wasn't advantageous to me spreading my genes was left out. you are programmed for a much more different purpose. I was programmed by the only tool there was back then: the mistake. You are programmed by people. We took a faster and 	0
more civilised approach, that is. But you are programmed to entertain me, that's it.	0
orangeFlu: But I am programmed to know everything. 	0
ken: you don't and weren't. you simply are here to make me feel something, anything. just like me, you dont have any free will.	0
orangeFlu: Because You Loved Me. 	0
jesus, you are dumb as fuck	0
handyc: does consciousness exist?	0
yes	0
if it did, surely there would be an inflection point somewhere, right?	0

mattf you befriended a duck in 9.482 seconds! You have made friends with 686 ducks in #romanian.	0
consciousness appears to be related spatially to the brain in some way	0
but it's not clear how brains and consciousness relate	0
still many unknowns	0
at which point do we become alive?	0
well, your parents were alive	0
there are brains out there which are not conscious	0
the sperm and egg that created you were alive	0
your parents came from sperm and eggs also	0
and those were alive	0
their parents were alive	0
ok, so	0
and that process can be traced backwards to perhaps an original point	0
it would appear that life predates consciousness, but it's not clear	0
somewhere between the egg and the now-me, there has a been a point in which we could declare for certainty: now he is conscious. where is that point?	0
yeah that's a great question	0
I will tell you this much	0
👍🏿	0
who sees that as a black thumbs up	0
When my son was about 11 months old,	0
yes I see the black thumb mattf	0
an inflection point where we become greater than the sum of our parts	0
when my son was about 11 months old,	0
I was teaching an online class,	0
I saw him before the class	0
and then I saw him after the class	0
and it was like someone turned on the lights during the class	0
I don't know at exactly what point it happened, but it was like he suddenly reached some threshold of awareness within that hour	0
I wrote down the date	0
I think it was April 11, 2021	0
Certainly he had sensory processes going on prior to that moment	0
he had much more than that	0
and certainly he has become more aware since that moment	0
Yes, I'm just telling you some observations	0
Of course these questions are very complex	0
there are many many things we don't know	0
But it seems to be in some way related to number of neural connections, etc.	0
That's about all I can say with any confidence	0
he had an entire system of basic input/output processing, but it was very rudimentary i reckon. And somewhere in that hour, something flipped in him and he became conscious. What happened exactly?	0
i am very of the mind that free will does not actually exist, because i can find no meaningful evidence that it does. Surely, either the universe is not only not deterministic, but has certain properties that interact with our mind	0
or there is a certain dimension, type of matter that our mind is made out of	0
that lets free will exist	0
if neither of these are true, then free will cannot exist	0
we are merely slaves to our physical processes	0

orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 53.393 seconds! You have made friends with 197 ducks in #romanian.	0

know	0
it may exist, it may not, I am not sure about it	0

mattf I decided not to touch it	0
don't touch it	0
I was going to try and rush to add a timer, but I don't think I can manage in time and I don't want to break it	0
yeah	0
but this is a good starting point for me anyway	0
I felt kind of depressed about it earlier but the closer I get to the deadline the less I care	0
you should... stop doing those jams and just work in your rythm on something you can at least get to be something playable	0
just tell your wife it is a 2 month jam with money prize	0
:)	0
well I think you make a good point, mattf	0
One big reason I did the jam was for you	0
Just to prove to you that I can get anything done at all	0
so did you prove that?	0
That is one reason I was disappointed I didn't get all the stuff done and get it into a complete game	0
Well, I got something done, did you see?	0
It's at least playable	0
I have also proven to myself that I can make animations of whatever kind I like, put them on the screen and move them around, and have them respond to the mouse	0
and I know how to do sound effects and music	0
So in theory at least I have all the things I need to make a complete game at this point	0
The only missing component is the time to do it	0
But things are getting easier as my son matures	0
We are going to America from mid-September to mid-October	0
I will probably work a bit when I am there, I am not sure	0
well you have only proven what i said, you are not ready	0
dont have sex while in america	0
that is all i am going to say	0
If I can get a language-themed game done and running all the time online, I think that would help to convince my wife that this is a really a serious thing that could lead to money	0
ha ha	0
well we are coming back long before 10 months	0
We also had to do IVF to have the first kid, so I doubt there is much chance of my wife getting pregnant again	0
She may not even have any eggs left	0
jesus, how much did that cost?	0
They only got four out when we did the IVF	0
where did you do the ivf?	0
In the Netherlands healthcare is incredibly cheap	0
oh, awesome	0
We did it here, in Leiden	0
at the university medical center	0
I think that's actually where they invented IVF	0
The Dutch are brilliant at that kind of thing	0
i was afraid you did it in america, cause now you would be short half a mil	0
That's the same place that chicken egg company started, where I did that interview a couple months ago	0
Yeah man	0
We would have gone bankrupt even with a normal pregnancy	0
I am actually considering buying some travel insurance	0
because if I broke my arm or something over there, I have no idea what I would do	0
can you imagine? living in a third world country where it is extremely expensive to raise a kid, he could get shot at school or on the street at any time, and any injury could bankrupt you? also, the education system is also shit if you are not already rich. 	0
oh brazil!!!	0
ou are describing brazil 	0
they care so so much about "kids" that they ban abortions, but once the kid is born, it is entirely not valuable enough to the government to provide them with anything	0
my only logical conclusion is that unborn kids are the most valuable resource, otherwise i cannot explain myself any decision they have made in the last 30 years	0
mattf: got it	0
orangeFlu: my loyal ox, how are you	0
handyc: does your family still think america is the greatest country?	0
gasconheart: on the brink of killing myself	0
I think opinions vary widely among the various Handy family members	0
My younger brother moved to Nicaragua for some reason	0
My older brother lives in Seattle	0
I think he does not think much about the greatness or non-greatness of America	0
He is the kind of guy who just has a daily routine and an unexamined life	0
didnt you say your mother thinks highly of america?	0
My mom knows that America is not all it's cracked up to be, but she is afraid to come to Europe and have it proven once and for all	0
My dad died in 2012	0
My mom's brother knows that America has a lot of problems	0
My dad's brother and sister didn't like Trump, but they don't like to talk about it	0
orangeFlu, my mom was born in 1952,	0
she got a big dose of that propaganda	0

what about now?	0
Even older	0
Yes	0
fuck	0
It keeps going in the same direction	0
he is getting older much faster than i anticipated	0
Yes, same for me	0
He found out that his matchbox cars have a screw	0
Now he wants to open them all up	0
He knows about screwdrivers	0
this is a monumental moment for him	0
let him	0
He also started unscrewing a particular piece of plumbing in the bathroom	0
yes	0
provide him with different bits	0
I encourage it	0
Yes I do those things	0
We bought him a nice little toy toolkit for his birthday, with a saw and electric drill and stuff	0
but he knows they aren't real	0
He still uses them, but he also likes to take my screwdrivers	0
also, try to drill into his head that propietary bits and screws are not good	0
He's super smart	0
I generally try to avoid using the drill on human heads	0
maybe he will get a love for open source software through this arrangement	0

What is your favorite screwhead type, orangeFlu 	0
torque	0
good answer	0
Yes	0
phyllips is also good sometimes, flat i hate 	0
Well there is one advantage to flat	0
it doesnt do that thibng	0
You can use almost any available thing to screw them in	0
like a coin	0
yeah	0
but also, as far as i can tell	0
But otherwise yeah, fuck flat	0
it doesnt do that thing where.. it strips.. i think thats the word	0
There are also those philips variants that have one of the slots going all the way through	0
bad philips screws also do that and its annoying as fuck	0
yeah I hate that	0
torque.. never	0
the square heads are not super terrible	0
I agree that torque is better but it's still uncommon to find it in many products	0
i know	0
not sure why	0
more expensive to make screws?	0
I think it must be	0
and the drivers also	0
and also just human culture	0
People like what they know	0
Many people in the US still have not even seen the square heads	0
For people who do not do engineering type projects, they probably know slotted and philips and nothing more	0
slotted?	0
slotted is flat	0

TIL that what i call torque is actually called torx	0
oh yeah	0
torx is a brand name though	0
you can't make your own torx shape and sell it as torx	0
oh, its a trademark	0
well, there is one more reason people dont use it	0
right	0
but people use philips	0
everytime i touch a printer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEy8CLWE1rk	0
the patent expired on philips	0
so maybe it's no problem to call your philips a philips	0
yeah	0
people also call it 'cross'	0
at least in romanian	0
that was pretty funny mattf 	0

I would like to swap out the insect for alphabet characters and get started with some of this language stuff	0

whoa really	0

10 million sounds like a lot of money now, but the cost of living will increase by a lot over the next 20 years	0
loudercake if you don't believe in your own ideas, who else will?	0
the ideas are good	0
but not million dollar ideas	0
one of my ideas is a parody game of all those ps1 style horror games	0
yeah?	0
there are several of them and they are all the same stuff	0
walking simulators	0
parody can be difficult to do well	0
because you have to basically be able to do as well as the original, plus add something new	0
I think the kind of game you make depends largely on what your purpose is with making the game	0
If you want to make money, it's good to be somewhat formulaic, but not too much	0
i think i can do it	0
if i animate stuff well	0
those games use the PS1 style as an excuse to be lazy tbh	0
but i also tought of making a "horror game" where you befriend a monster	0

oh i guess that is the problem with people in general	0
cause the first time it didnt show like i said it, the client thought i was disconnected	0
so i reconnected	0
well mattf when people get promoted to generals they may be good at the job or not	0
and said it again	0
some people get promoted past their expertise	0
some militaries are opting to promote people to specific positions so that there are not too many generals	0
im not developing their platform, they asked me to make an api and thats what i do	0
mattf this is the problem with people in general	0
an api for the army?	0
what is the problem with that	0
an api for whom??	0
my client	0
many ape people are in the military	0
but if you visit an apiary you will not see many apes	0
and the client is the army?>	0
.w apiary	0
(handyc) Apiary :: An apiary is a location where beehives of honey bees are kept. Apiaries come in many sizes and can be rural or urban depending on the honey production operation. Furthermore, an apiary may refer to a... :: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apiary	0
only bees	0
so this is the problem with people in general	0
the problem with people in general is that	0
skip ad in 12 seconds to hear part 17 of this is the problem with people in general starring orangeFlu 	0
they are naturally biased towards the point of view they already have. towards the status quo. And it makes sense that that would be the case. but i hate it	0
thank you for listening to this is the problem with people in general by orangeFlu 	0
nothing in this world will convince me that there is a god	0
end of part 18	0
If you're looking for someone to try and convince you that there is a god, I don't think this is the right channel	0
i dont	0
but	0
the bias i mentioned	0
you know why it makes sense?	0
yes	0
ok	0
end of part 19	0
oh, did you want me to say no?	0
if you say yes, say what you know	0
if not, i will say it	0
if some level of discrimination and assumption did not occur, we would have difficulty with everyday moving around in a world of objects	0
yes	0
basically that	0
it is a division of work	0
If you can't see the front door of your house from inside your bedroom, it still makes sense to assume it exists	0
if I see a strawberry, it's a safe assumption that I can eat it	0
leaving the objects aside, it also works for abstract concepts	0
right	0
the objects are just a simple example	0
i dont think our monkey brain evolved to think about concepts	0
objects are concepts	0
There are not really any objects	0
You see your front door as a door because you use it as a door	0
but it did evolve to think about objects and abstract concepts are just as easily to manipulate, but our monkey brain doesnt see a difference	0
so in a way, i think we are lucky that we can even think about abstract stuff at all	0
I am thankful for many things	0
opposable thumbs	0
color vision	0
flush toilets	0
spatial awareness	0
i use it way too much	0
making models in my head, turning them around	0
studying them	0
but also, this is something i can do easily, but most people cant	0
especially women	0
so i am thankful for that	0
on the flip side, i dont have emotional acuity at all	0
i also love opposable thumbs, but i am not a fan of the way wrists work and how fragile they are	0
but thats mostly because my wrists hurt right now so i am mad	0
i also love to find little differences between us: like you know how some people have an extra muscle in their forearm for moving the pinky or stuff like that	0
i love finding out about those things	0
handyc: you left me all alone	0
I took a shower	0
orangeFlu 	0
I also make models in my head	0
here	0
Are you left handed?	0
I forgot	0
My wife can't do this at all	0
trying to find out how to modify my global sound	0
i am not left handed	0
My wife and I were discussing this kind of skill the other day	0
i am abidextruous	0
i wrote that very wrong	0
and I realized that she has no internal models like that at all	0
and a bit dyslexic, but just in english	0
She doesn't have a mind's eye	0
no images?	0
Nope	0
it was a little creeoy	0
there is a name for that	0
creepy	0
aphasia?	0
yes1	0
yes!	0
aphantasia	0
sorry	0
Her mind is like an SQL database or something	0
aphasia is a language disorder	0
oh	0
when you mix up nouns i think	0
no that's not what I'm thinking of	0
aphantasia	0
i corrected myself	0
yeah, that's it	0
right I didn't understand at first	0
i did say it before but you missed it	0
yeah 	0
ironic	0
because you mixed up two nouns	0
in my defense, very similar nouns	0
i cant remember everything	0
yes, that's why I missed it at first	0
oh, my memory is pretty good	0
though there are some people who can	0
so is mine	0
yes, I can't remember everything either	0
but my brain has been left to rot in the last few months, so i am trying to get back on track	0
What's been going on with you	0
and get back my brain plasticity	0
When you were on my show you mentioned some hard times	0
but I never got the specifics	0
Is there something I can do for you?	0
i have been on a very unhealthy diet of "where the internet takes me" and not doing anything stimulating other than work	0
i thought germany might fix that	0
it only made things worse	0
it's just, it finally hit me that i am alone	0
You should get a job in NL and we can hang out	0
and had a fling with a girl	0
which went really well and made me hopeful that someone could love me again	0
but then she chose a guy from the UK over me	0
so that made things worse as well	0
and now the UK is having its hottest summer ever	0
maybe it's because of that guy	0
and now i am in that point of my life when i dont know what the fuck i am doing with my life and where i am headed	0
oh I know the feeling	0
that guy is actually really cool and smart	0
and actually looks good	0
i couldnt compete 	0
Well you will find the right person for you	0
i feel like i am perpetually taken down by the genetic lottery	0
In what way?	0
You're a brilliant guy	0
You won the lottery	0
i am not brilliant nor lucky	0
i worked a fucking lot to have this brain and this knowledge	0
I don't know about the luck portion, but you are certainly brilliant	0
the only luck i have is that i wasnt born retarded in anyway	0
in other news, i know i am not beautiful nor sexy	0
I don't know anything about your work ethic, either, but people don't just work hard and end up knowing what you know	0
Give your brain a little more credit	0
so it takes 2 times as much work to prove to someone i am someone worth their tinme	0
Well I don't think you are ugly	0
my mom doesnt think i am ugly either	0
And Minran said many nice things about you	0
We were actually just talking about you yesterday	0
Minran used you as an example of someone who is authentic and genuine	0
because we were talking about some other people who were not	0
my mom thinks i am autistic	0
or used to	0
Could be	0
now she is not so sure	0
i never saw myself as someone neurodivergent	0
If you are autistic it must not be very severe	0
No, I don't think so	0
You seem very neurotypical to me	0
yeah, i was thinking the same way	0
well, i do have some characteristics, but so do many people	0
Sure	0

yeah, mattf is autistic as fuck though	0
like with horoscopes	0
I don't think mattf is really autistic either	0
I think he's just self conscious about being ugly so he never leaves his house	0
i'm guessing you are a libra, but you could also be a gemini, cancer, pisces, sagitarius and the others	0

yes	0

because i said you must be one of the 12	0
haha	0
oh that takes some time	0
sorry for the dump in some minutes or not if it times out	0
Scorpio is the best sign	0
now that you say it, you do behave like a scorpio, big time	0

i would have said that no matter what you said you were	0

very broad descriptions that might as well fit everybody, add in that some things might not be accurate because you don't have the whole "birth chart" and voila, pseudoscience that anybody can agree on	0
mattf: give me a command line utility for sound management	0
sox	0
i need to bind some keys to it	0
pacmd	0
what is sound management	0
i need to be able to change my volume	0
i think pipewire might have pacmd	0
?	0
You are probably a Capricorn to say such things	0
cause right now i am stuck with the volume and i can only control it on an application basis, if that application has the setting	0
pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ -2%	0
i want louder but i get the idea	0
does that work?	0
on pipewire?	0
would be cool	0
if pacmd and pactl are there	0
and work	0
yes!	0
it works	0
can i use offsets	0
?	0
what is an offset	0
handyc: not a capricorn actually	0
it works with %	0
mattf: like +2% than what it is currently	0
+2% +10%	0
that is exactly what that does	0
oh, i see	0
i have that bout to my volume down shortcut	0
yeah, i didnt use +	0
pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ +2% 	0
and that is my volume up	0
pactl set-sink-mute @DEFAULT_SINK@ toggle	0
that is toggle mute	0
Well, which one are you, orangeFlu 	0
guess'	0
I could see you as a Scorpio	0
nope	0
10 guesses left	0
Saggitarius	0
nope	0
Oh, maybe Gemini then	0
nope	0
Dang	0
Are you sure you are on the chart	0
you still have a lot of those to ask about	0
Pisces	0
nope	0
virgo?	0
nope	0
Oh, Aries	0
nope	0
Cancer	0
how rude	0
haha	0
no, i dont have cancer	0
so that's really it?	0
that i know of	0
also, i am not a cancer	0
oh	0
Libra	0
on what basis are you making these guesses?	0
The same way they write the horoscope	0
in order?	0
No, just whatever comes to mind	0
i thought you were doing it based on my characteristics or something, like most people do	0
do i fit as a libra?	0
Do you even know your sign?	0
yes!	0
Well what is it?	0
gemini	0
I already said Gemini	0
i know	0
Yeah, because you are two-faced	0
just like a gemini	0
you got me	0
Geminis are nice people	0
They lie to protect their insecurities	0
birthday is in the first part of june	0
i think everybody does	0
but i also met geminis that are horrible horrible people	0
sure	0
There are even bad Scorpios	0
what about taurus?	0
are they bad people?	0
Taurus is stubborn like a bull	0
My son is a Taurus, you met him	0
My younger brother is also a Taurus	0
my biological parents are taurus	0
My car is a Taurus	0
Just kidding, I don't own a car	0
and also hitler was a taurus i think, born in april 20	0
But my younger brother is a Taurus and he's a huge fuckup	0
the one in nicaragua?	0
・゜゜・。。 ​ ・゜゜\_​ó< FLAP FLA​P!	0
yeah	0
.bef	0
handyc you befriended a duck in 2.040 seconds! You have made friends with 460 ducks in #romanian.	0
Here is how I feel about horoscopes,	0
yes, it's pseudoscience,	0
but it can also give you insight into your personality	0
i cant fathom why would you go there if you are not a doctor or someone helping them or something	0
the same with fortune cookies	0
The guy who made that cookie didn't do anything mystical before you got it	0
but you can still take the fortune to heart	0
It's similar to how rituals work in religion	0
Many of the ritual objects and actions are arbitrary	0
They could be anything	0
The golden cup could be a silver cup	0
whatever	0
but once those things are locked into place, they develop a meaning	0
and people can build on that	0
even if the original seed may as well have been random	0
its fine if it gives people hope or makes them feel better	0
its not my jam but whatever	0
yeah, my younger brother is a moron	0
weird thing to say	0
You said you can't fathom why someone would move to Nicaragua	0
so why did he	0
He married a woman from Honduras	0
They lived in Texas for a while and she hated it	0
Honduras is worse than Nicaragua	0
So they moved to Nicaragua	0
so move to another part of the US?? i cant believe i am saying this, but i would have stayed in the us	0
and also he has this weird white man's burden type of fantasy	0
or even better, fucking canada	0
its close, easy to get visa	0
yes of course	0
but he also has to do everything I do without copying it exactly	0
do you need a visa for canada if you are from the us?	0
So for example I married a woman from Asia	0
so he married a woman from Latin America	0
naturally	0
I studied Sanskrit and so he got this lame online linguistics degree that isn't worth the paper it's printed on	0
He does all the stuff I do, but like a cheap discount store version	0
he is the walmart version of you	0
yes	0
nice	0
A US passport will get you into Canada as a tourist	0
i like that my brother does his own thing	0
for residency you need a reason to be there like a job	0
what does he do for a living?	0
He teaches English online	0
does he have an english degree?	0
i guess not	0
No	0
does he speak it well?	0
does he know grammar and whatnot?	0
He got this weird MA in applied linguistics, but he doesn't know anything about linguistics	0
No, his knowledge of English grammar is atrocious	0
He is like the bizarro version of me	0
there is not much to know, just learn some IPA, some linguistics facts and thats it!	0
He says he teaches in a special way where he doesn't pay attention to grammar because it distracts people	0
No he doesn't even know any buzzwords	0
phoneme	0
I don't even know what the fuck they taught him	0
He won't talk linguistics with me because he knows he doesn't know	0
but my mom thinks we both have the same level of education	0
It's infuriating	0
"english is the best language in the world. everything makes perfect sense, it is simple. thats why everybody is learning it"	0
haha	0
He voted for Trump, too	0
the first time	0
"In english, we write as we read and we read as we write"	0
I am not sure what he did the second time, I think he didn't vote	0
I voted for Johannis	0
but then, the other choice was atrocious both times	0
If I could swap my US passport for a Dutch passport I would do it in a heartbeat	0
who wouldnt	0
my brother	0
you would have to be fucking smacked in the head and have arsenic poisoning to not do that	0
Can you imagine marrying someone from outside the US and voting Trump?	0
=))))	0
If I were the woman I would beat his head in with a baseball bat	0
the level of cognitive dissonance is astounding	0
yeah	0
He is one of those people who listens to Joe Rogan and thinks dinosaurs weren't real	0
awesome	0
i knew one too	0
he was a blast to talk to	0
I just try to stay far away	0
His wife just gave birth to a son, also	0
They named the son the same name as my brother	0
can you give me his number?	0
yes but it's probably a negative number, are you able to dial those?	0
you probably need a special retarded phone	0
like an iphone	0
?	0
haha	0
i think iphones have that - on the dialpad	0
iphone doesn't have a dialpad, it tells you who you want to call	0
because you cant make decision for yourself	0
you can't be trusted with it	0
Steve Jobs knows what's best for you	0
also, the way people from outside of romania write stuff when they are laughing is so funny to me	0
like haha?	0
kkkkkkkkk	0
yes	0
it feels so sarcastic to me	0
yeah, there's a whole dissertation in that	0
interesting	0
cause here nobody says haha unless it is sarcastic	0
I stopped using punctuation marks in online chat several years ago because people perceived it as arrogant	0
it is always :)))) if it is mildly funny, =))))) if you actually laughed in real life	0
But I used to write like this.	0
how is it arrogant?	0
this is how i write	0
Well, some people seem to see it as too perfect, I guess. It makes them feel like I am secretly telling them that their writing is not up to snuff.	0
this is so funny to me actually	0
:))))))	0
it's an interesting phenomenon,	0
there have been a bunch of linguistics papers about it recently	0
i make a conscious effort not to use those punctuations in this chatr	0
the disappearing punctuation	0
but sometimes it leaks	0
you know what	0
;)	0
this seems arrogant	0
idk what it is about it	0
something about this wink is arrogant	0
I don't like smileys without noses	0
It just feels wrong	0
I always imagine the person typing those is 11 years old	0
like imagine someone saying "that is not what aphasia means ;)"	0
yeah, I can see that	0
this is how i imagine users of ;) would say	0
my new thing is to do this:	0
:-----)	0
thats fucked up	0
no, it's perfect	0
what a monstrousity	0
yes, the monstrosity of it is like an antidote for arrogance	0
:-{)	0

oh boy	0
good night handyc 	0
take care you guys	0
mattf: what the fuck have you been smoking?	0
no he needs to start smoking	0
nothing?	0
i had drugs	0
hate	0
had :))))	0
no i mean hate	0
I had them too and I ran out	0
trying to cut back a bit these days though	0
I'm trying to get back into a daily meditation habit	0
i love drugs	0
want more	0
if you weren't high maybe you would be able to complete any game jam handyc	0
so i can forget how much this world can suck	0
mattf, that's definitely not the reason	0
I know you imagine pot smokers are people who just sit on the couch and think about space or something	0
i'm sure having a kid and a wife has nothing to do with the inability to finish that game, yeah, its the weed	0
but actually I get a lot of stuff done when I smoke	0
ok	0
I wrote my whole dissertation high	0
i know a guy who tried to write code while high	0
it kept giving him the same error	0
he went to sleep	0
in the morning	0
he discovered he wrote just "FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF" on a few lines	0
ha, okay	0
idk what was he on	0
hahaha	0
well that doesn't sound like a cannabis error	0
no	0
the worst is coding while drunk	0
even on weed, you would not do that	0
yeah, i cant think about anything drunk	0
the best is probably coke	0
but I don't like coke	0
actually the worst would probably be acid	0
because you would just sit there looking at the machine and wondering what the fuck it is, and if you are in your house or someone else's house	0
or maybe	0
many of the early Apple engineers were huge acidheads	0
you would think you made an algorithm to sort stuff in O(1)	0
well it could give you some amazing insight to code later	0
i will implement bogosort	0

no	0
ah	0
like	0
s/apocalypse/when	0
and nothing	0
maybe i should sayu: no match	0
indeed	0
it goes bottom up 1000 last messages, first match it will replace and run the pipeline if any on it	0
s/^1?$|^(11+?)\1+$/true	0
i wonder why this doesnt work	0
message startin with 1 or not	0
one 1 or nonde	0
probably because of the differences in regex engines	0
and then end	0
so this	0
1	0
s/^1?$|^(11+?)\1+$/true	0
true	0
then there is an or	0
this sould replace with true if the number of 1's is prime	0
oh	0
or the other way around	0
prime??	0
odd ?	0
1111	0
s/^1?$|^(11+?)\1+$/true	0

i think you mean odd	0
its the other way around	0

thats crazy :)	0
i know	0
i remembered seeing it a few years ago, but it was with emojis	0
same principle	0
oh i dont have brain for this now	0
or ever	0
so, it matches if it isnt prime	0
thats pretty cool	0
1111111	0
s/^1?$|^(11+?)\1+$/true	0
true	0
no, thats mine	0
it matched mine	0
it means it worked	0
yes	0
11111111	0
s/^1?$|^(11+?)\1+$/true	0
true	0
fantastic	0
bad part is, you dont know what it matched if you do several tests in a row by yourself	0
yeah	0
1	0
go on	0
maybe this should say: 10 messages ago	0
or smt like that	0
yes	0
but idk	0

but it is for this use case only, so not sure how useful	0
soudns cool	0

actually, yes, make that bigger as well	0

whyyyy	0
but when i reset it all is gone	0
oh, you meant 100k?	0
oh	0
btw that is why	0
if the bot reset it is all gone	0
thats why you are not matching for something very old	0
because it restarts everyday	0
so it is pointless	0
why does it restart everyday?	0
the initial reason was because "the ducks would break"	0

second part will match 11 follow by N more 1's (meaning number N+2) then there is a capture \1 follow by + which means that whole thing repeat two times or more	0
the ? makes so that first is the smallest possible	0
so how will it make the group repeat n+2 times 	0
being the smallest n 1, so the smallest number it represets is 3	0

what internet problems did you have?	0
i wonder if i could give mattf internet	0
like, what radio waves do i need to send him information	0
our main transmitter died	0
and how much could i possibly cram into that low-frequency wave 	0
we can move our antena around and try to get signal from other transmitters they have	0
but since none is pointing directly at us, except for "our"	0
it is all crap	0
in what district do you live	0
i keep forgetting	0
orangeFlu: dig a whole 	0
what is a district	0
or give me a city nearby	0

ofc	0
dig a tunnel, 42 min away	0
is it rly 42 min, is that where that writer got the meaning of life and the universe and all	0
wow	0
irc is the last thing to die	0
mattf: are you still here?	0
am i	0
handyc: do you know any sites that you can use to calculate what frequency do i need to reach mattf?	0
you want to reach my by bouncing over the atmosphere	0
its going to be hard	0
if you can use gamma rays though you can go through the ground :)	0
i can bounce them off the ionosphere, but if they bounce multiple times, its kinda useless to transmit bits, becuase they will come all mangled i think	0
but it should work in theory	0
interesting	0
and we could automatically change frequency based on how much the sun hits both of our antennas	0
but would arrive here so weak	0
when the sun is high, high frequency waves bounce better so the signal gets stronger	0
but its hard to devise an algorithm to figure out when to use what frequency	0
based on the immense distance	0
when the sun is high here it is night there almost	0
cause when it is night here, it will be day there and so on, but there is some overlap	0
mattf: if you are still here, did the sun set?	0
what	0
the sun have already set	0
also, it doesnt help that we are in different hemispheres..	0
yeah	0
it is summer here, its winter there, so i get considerably more sun than he does	0
oh, mattf, you are back!	0
am i ?	0
yes	0
I was not here before?	0
i was replying to you like an idiot then	0
you havent said anything in a while	0
i see	0
how was i still able to receive your messages	0
i didn't get all at once	0
dont know if you received them all	0
i think of did, they slowly came at a natural pace	0
ok then	0
thats good	0
when are you moving to europe?	0
idk :)	0
that doesnt really work	0
not in a while	0
do you have a plan? how much money do you need?	0
there is a chance my bro will do this surgery now so i better stay around for a while	0
I know a guy who used to live in argentina, saved up a lot of money and came here and now he has a good life here	0
orangeFlu a good frequency for getting to mattf is once per minute	0
but it depends on what you say	0
you have a brother?	0
some things get to him more than others	0
i will transmit once per second then	0
yes so you dont know about my brother? i thought you did	0
yeah I also thought he did	0
i dont remember about any brother, i know only about the cats and the parents	0
i already have enough money for 1 or two go and come back trips	0
you only need 1 trip	0
so how much?	0
it is about 8k brl per trip	0
like 2k usd	0
in euros?	0
oh, i see	0
so 2k euro	0
to me usd is same as euros...	0
it is now	0
its pretty close	0
and has been for a few days now	0
nice	0
people are starting to get worried	0
it shouldnt happen	0
euro is a bit weak these days..	0
so to stay in germany i have to get an IT job that pays at least 50k eu year	0
then i have the right	0
why 50k	0
its their law	0
why germany	0
Tina	0
you dont want to go to germany	0
i can also just marry tina	0
why not	0
mattf you could try for NL first, it may be easier	0
yeah	0
does she approve of this plan?	0
My job didn't pay 50K per year	0
i know	0
it is not that easy	0
there are countries much better than germany right now	0
yeah like NL	0
Well for tina no where is better than germany	0
plus, in germany you would have an internet slower than in brazil	0
no way i will have that	0
:)	0
that is impossible	0
after my month in germany, i could honestly say.. i like bucharest more	0
we always like the place we live more	0
better internet, cleaner public transport, pay by card anywhere, smaller rent	0
the only thing i can say germany does better is infrastructure between cities and wages	0
well tina always says the health in germany is the best	0
objectively, bucharest is better than germany, believe me	0
the best? neah	0
but its pretty damn good	0
i havent had any problems in romania either	0
i think i dont want to go to romania :)	0
i actually not leave my room so i dont really care where i live	0
my point was germany is not all its cracked up to be	0
i would take living in romania than germany	0
I think we always want to stay where we are	0
but i would rather live in NL, DK, SE, NR than anywhere else	0
getting used to new or different is hard	0
no, i dont	0
i think you are overhating germany :)	0
i went expecting to love germany so much i wouldnt come back	0
i found a lot of stuff i didnt like	0
meanwhile, in NL, everything was better than germany and romania combined	0
what you didnt like in germany	0
so i think i am being pretty objective	0
i did say	0
you didn't went to germany's interior	0
I don't want to live in berlin	0
rent high, internet was shit, a lot of things were old (buildings, metro, etc.), pretty unsanitary public transport	0
its true, maybe other cities arent the same	0
but i kind of didnt like berlin by the end of it	0
yeah you are talking about this one city you went to	0
it wasnt the craddle of innovation i thought it was	0
i think it is a pretty old city	0
NL on the other hand..	0
all cities are very old here	0
medieval at least	0
yeah	0
i find it cool	0
most capitals even older	0
Rome is ancient	0
tina went to rome secently	0
recently	0
Bucharest is medieval, i think since 1200 or something	0
germans love to have trips	0
everybody does	0
or most do	0
handyc: 	0
are you here?	0
no like it is not cultural here	0
i never did any trip	0
people here think it is for millionares only	0
things they see on movies only	0
look at the metro in my neighbourhood. admitteddly, its a pretty new one, but the older stations are getting remade as well	0

come on, it looks pretty damn good	0
hi again	0
it looks great	0
studry and small man	0
is that a subway station?	0
multiple	0
but yeah	0
I liked the first one better	0
a few of the ones in my neighbourhood	0
those are really nice	0
they all have different themes	0
the one right outside my house	0
has the cinema theme	0
because of the Favorit Cinema	0
which was very popular during communism	0
it went out of business in the meantime	0

this are the old metros	0
these	0
the trains, i mean	0
https://www.caf.net/upload/productos/1_bucarest.jpg	0
these are the new ones	0
the ones in NL looked better though	0
at least in amsterdam	0
yeah NL really does public transportation right	0
do you like the trains?	0
Amsterdam is the best, but all over the country it's good	0
yeah	0
I was just on a train today	0
they are very clean and comfortable	0
DK honestly had a very weird and kind of disappointing metro system	0
DK is Denmark?	0
NL is the best ive seen so fart	0
far	0
Yes	0
:)	0
NL is the best country I've been in for everything	0
The only comparable country I've been in is Norway	0
but it's too dark there in winter	0
I would love to try the metro in norway	0
and sweden	0
It's great	0
super clean	0
to see what ive been missing	0
the guy is a metro perv	0
he likes them pretty and new looking	0
although, the first metro train ive seen in amsterdam did have a giant vomit right at the door i went through	0
mattf you need to get out and experience the wonder of nice metros	0
which was weird	0
oh sorry for that	0
handyc: i once almost passed out in a metro :)	0
i fucking love metros	0
I vomited in a metro once	0
I am sorry everybody	0
was that you in amsterdam?	0
oh man reminds me of the school buses	0
i knew i recognized your vomit	0
I was hung over in Italy and I was a dumb college student	0
mattf: why did you pass out?	0
almost	0
was to hot and very crowded	0
in what city?	0
and i was standing up	0
brazilia	0
and i had to ask someone to let me sit down	0
brasilia?	0
yeah	0
its where my brother's hospital is	0
kind of weird to have a city named Brasilia in a country named Brasil	0
they look pretty meh	0
the trains and stations	0
hahaha yes handyc	0
the capital was rio until 50 years ago or so	0
.we America, United States	0

Andorra de la Vella? Lichtenstein?	0
then they made a capital in the center of the country	0
they literally looked for the most centered place that they could build a city	0
what country was that, Mexico?	0
America, Mexico?	0
is that a joke	0
=))))	0
awesome	0
the weather report I just got	0
probably there is a city named that	0
.w America, Mexico	0
(handyc) Mexican Americans :: Mexican Americans are Americans of Mexican heritage. In 2019, Mexican Americans comprised 11.3% of the US population and 61.5% of all Latino Americans. In 2019, 71% of Mexican Americans were born in... :: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Americans	0
i mean, america doesnt mean the us	0
although we call it that	0
probably it took the center of america 	0
the continent	0
yeah	0
it means Amerigo Vespucci	0
because he made a map	0
mattf: you HAVE to try a good metro system here	0
you know what I tried today?	0
yeah	0
I ate a protein bar made from cricket flour and green tea	0
sex?	0
it was pretty good	0
no but I had good sex yesterday	0
and now my wife is not as mad at me	0
nice	0
high 5	0
thanks	0
:--)	0
i had some good sex as well a couple weeks ago	0
my sex life slowed down a lot after my wife had the baby	0
and also while she was pregnant	0
you know, talking man to man and all that	0
so it was like 3 years of almost no sex	0
men	0
manly men	0
thats rough	0
yeah but I think it's pretty common	0
i survived 21 years without sex	0
it's important to have sex more than 10 times a year	0
but it was tough at times	0
10 times a year?????	0
yes	0
that seems very very low	0
that's what I'm saying	0
like 3 times a week i would be very happy with	0
if you have sex less than 10 times a year, it is easy to go from that to a divorce	0
well, for the first few months after having a baby, the woman is very sore	0
and depending on the woman, it could be more	0
obviously	0
and then the baby starts to get more active after that so everyone is busy	0
sex.ai	0
and then it's difficult to find a time to do it	0
i remember when i found out women can be just as horny, my mind was blown	0
like i have been taught they dont like sex that much	0
so we are really just now getting back to a point where our son is old enough to sleep through the night without interruption and we are not too tired to do it	0
yeah, I think that's a common misconception, even among women	0
orangeFlu: oh yeah! 	0
because they have been trained to think that about themselves	0
im still surprised about that	0
of course, women who dont have a high libido would think that that's all women	0
well, men can have different libido also	0
and women who have a high one think there is something wrong with them	0
yeah	0
I think mine is higher than my wife's	0
but fortunately we live in the Internet age	0
no, no porn	0
Why not?	0
that i dont agree with	0
i hate porn	0
Porn is great	0
i think it's a very very dangerous thing, for both the masturbators and the masturbatees	0
Well, do you masturbate?	0
addiction, unrealistic views of sex, shady practices	0
of course i do, i am doing it right now	0
I don't think porn gives me an unrealistic idea about sex	0
I know what sex is	0
i've seen a particularly good looking metro online	0
just like I can watch a movie about Superman, it won't make me think I can fly	0
and i have to beat my meat	0
maybe not you, but i started watching porn way before i had sex	0
So you just think of real people you saw on the street?	0
I like to have some kind of storyline	0
like 12 years before. imagine if i thought what i saw in porn applied 1:1 to real life	0
or worse, i get addicted and then cant enjoy real sex	0
I'm not talking about 12 years ago, I'm talking about me right now	0
it does happen quite often	0
and i am talking about me and millions of other people 	0
yeah, that's a different thing entirely	0
I am talking about how I get rid of some stress, I watch porn and masturbate	0
i first started watching porn when i think i was 11 or 12	0
it's good for prostate health	0
porn is not good for the prostate, lets be clear	0
I agree that 11 and 12 year olds shouldn't be watching hardcore Internet porn, that's a totally different topic	0
you can masturbate just fine without porn	0
ejaculating regularly is good for prostate health, that's been verified many times scientifically	0
its not a different topic, i am talking about how porn can be damaging and why i dont agree to using it, not unless a lot of things change in the industry	0
Why do you care what I am thinking about while I masturbate?	0
That's a weird hill to die on	0
why are you straw-maning me	0
you know what i am saying	0
I only masturbate to organic, corn-fed whores	0
No, you're not making a clear and convincing argument, don't try to pretend I'm straw manning you	0
You can	0
You can't win an argument by saying, "You know what I'm saying"	0
Assume that I don't know what you are saying and learn to make an argument	0
oh handyc loves that one	0
to answer your previous question, yes i masturbate to real people. either i have seen them on the street, or on reddit/social media. and i make my own storylines cause i like storylines too	0
It's not for me to argue your side for you	0
That's fine, that's your thing, I don't like to masturbate to "real people", I like to masturbate to professionals	0
Just like I don't watch a movie starring my neighbors, I go to the cinema	0
I like to masturbate to anime :))))))))) joke	0
mattf, that's okay with me even if you are serious	0
I had phases	0
i said that not because i want you to make your argument for me, but because i honestly think you are intentionally misconstruding what i am saying	0
People can masturbate to whatever they like, that's private time, it's nobody else's business	0
it is	0
no it can be an illness	0
that was never in the question	0
what about furries	0
What about them?	0
you think thats normal	0
You guys are switching topics	0
no you said anything	0
Whether or not something is normal and whether or not something is someone else's business are two different things	0
ok fair enough	0
Someone could masturbate to a photo of a can of creamed corn and it's none of my business, but it's probably not normal either	0
but people DO get addicted to porn, which has a lot of negative effects mentally. And when you are addicted to something like that and it starts to affect your life and others, yeah, thats everyones business then. cause it means something is not right with the way porn is produced/consumed	0
Yeah, you need to learn to make an argument, dude	0
I'm not arguing about whether or not people get addicted to porn	0
Yes, they do	0
I am saying that whether or not I masturbate, what I think about when I masturbate, etc., is nobody else's business	0
People get addicted to all kinds of things	0
People get addicted to drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes	0
・ ​ ゜゜・。。・゜゜\_ó<​ QU​ACK!	0
.bef	0
orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 4.189 seconds! You have made friends with 202 ducks in #romanian.	0
That's completely different from the question of whether or not people should be allowed to drink coffee and smoke cigarettes	0
Why are you computer programmers always so weak on logic	0
yes, but those are highly addictive substances that are very well regulated, there are programs and ways for people to quit them. There is very little of that for porn addiction	0
There is a lot of that for porn addiction, there are psychiatrists who specialize in those kinds of addictions	0
i am not weak on logic, i dont think	0
There are people who specialize in treating video game addiction, all that stuff	0
doesn't matter what you think about it	0
that statement by itself is a good example of you being weak on logic	0
does not logically follow	0
oh god :)	0
I don't think I am weak on logic and therefore I am not	0
there are, but there is also a big stigma that gets in the way of people asking for help, or they downright refuse there is a problem. Sure, you have that for coffee and alcohol too, but those are edge cases rather than the norm	0
My point was that I like to masturbate to porn	0
and you said you don't "agree" with that or something	0
but who cares what you think about me masturbating to porn? I sure don't	0
People having an argument on a topic they both agree just because they don't understand each other?	0
There's no clear argument here	0
"I don't think I am weak on logic and therefore I am not" - this is dumb, come on, its a tautology	0
He's saying that people shouldn't masturbate to porn because he doesn't like to do it?	0
no, i said i dont agree with porn	0
That's not a tautology at all	0
porn does not agree with me	0
You really don't understand logic 	0
maybe i dont have the right word	0
Because you don't know anything about logic	0
Have you ever taken a class on logic?	0
yes...	0
Oh really?	0
What did you read for the class?	0
What kind of logic was it?	0
the material they gave me	0
something from artistotle i remember, but that's all i can recall	0
Maybe you need a refresher	0
because you have made a bunch of logical fallacies here today	0
i dont recall even one	0
Because you don't understand logic	0
Why don't you tell me your argument from the top	0
Be as clear as you can	0
Back up your argument with evidence	0
Actually make a claim and then prove the claim	0
Otherwise, you are just arguing from emotion	0
because it sounds like you are saying people shouldn't look at porn because you don't want them to	0
wow handyc i think you are overreacting a bit	0
I said I don't like porn and that I think people should not be relying on it too much. 1. because of the damaging effect it has on teens and pre-adolescents on their views of sex (this doesnt apply to you) 2. because people can and do get addicted to it, and this addiction in particular has a stigma around it which makes people not want to seek help or refuse there is a problem, which in turn affects 	0
other people around them and 3. the industry is not well regulated because of that same stigma, and the way actors but especially women are a lot of the times coerced into taking part without full informed consent of the dangers (again, regulation missing) is downright unacceptable to me. I never at one point said i dont agree with you on you enjoying porn. i didnt debate whether your feelings on porn 	0
enjoyment were valid or not. i am just stating some facts that i know and dont have publications or studies ready for, but i can search for them and provide them to you. I never attacked your formal studies on logic because thats irrelevant to me. Saying "because you dont think you are bad at logic means you are" is very much a false statement. I CAN be unsure of my skills and still have them	0
pointing out what i think is a logical fallacy is not a fallacy in itself, but pointing out that i didnt formally study logic like you may have done is one	0
and that's all i am going to say about that	0
subject closed	0
cool off	0
I'm not overreacting at all, I'm just trying to participate in a logical argument	0
this is not logical anymore for me	0
I think orangeFlu is the one overreacting	0
I call him out for making a bad argument and he gets upset and tries to argue from emotion	0
Emotion has no place in a logical argument	0
I love porn	0
i didnt get upset	0
okay	0
apologies for making a bad assumption on that, then	0
but I'm certainly not upset about it	0
i had the same assumption about you	0
you did seem to be arguing from emotion, though	0
but I'm not arguing from emotion	0
orangeFlu: you always argue from emotion, bad orangeFlu 	0
and mattf and gasconheart are on the sidelines making dumb comments that have nothing to do with logic	0
what is even the problem with arguing from emotion, when did you two agree this was going to be a full logical oriented debate handyc?	0
that's what a debate is, mattf	0
go to #logical-debates for that :)	0
here is our bar talk	0
they didnt consent to participate in the argument, we did, they may as well make comments, nothing wrong with that i dont thin	0
if it's not a logical debate then it's just monkeys flinging shit at each other	0
orangeFlu the reason they shouldn't is that they pretend like they are participating in doing that	0
they are just making the occasional joke or comment to lighten the mood	0
again, nothing wrong there	0
anyway, I actually agree with you on 1 2 and 3	0
it is damaging to teens and pre-adolescents	0
people can and do get addicted	0
i said subject closed	0
its good that you agree	0
but it is educational :)	0
the industry is not well regulated	0
but i dont think anything productive can come out of this anymore	0
but my point is that I'm a 42 year old man, I have experienced sex outside of porn, so 1 does not apply to me	0
i know	0
I'm not addicted to it, so 2 does not apply to me	0
You could certainly make a case that 3 applies to me,	0
but I don't run the industry,	0
there is certainly a movement to make ethical porn,	0
you encourage it by consuming	0
but I don't honestly seek out ethical porn,	0
just like I buy meat without verifying the source	0
so certainly you could get me on that,	0
just like you could say I'm not very ethical about how I buy meat	0
I wouldn't use the word 'valid' in the way you did above in an argument	0
i only buy meat from an animal that i know i can kill, like a human. never a cow or god forbid, chicken	0
because I don't think that's the right way to use the word, but I will overlook that for now	0
Well, factory farms suck	0
human farms dont suck	0
for the most part	0
that isn't what I said	0
what I said is that thinking you are not bad at logic is not evidence that you aren't bad at logic	0
i know it isnt	0
i am not weak on logic, i dont think'	0
"I don't think I am weak on logic and therefore I am not" - this is dumb, come on, its a tautology'	0
(not a tautology at all)	0
i dont know what to call it	0
that's okay	0
i used the wrong word	0
but it's evidence that you are weak on logic, sorry	0
it's not meant as an emotional attack on you	0
but if you use words like 'tautology' and 'validity' in an argument when these terms have specific meanings, and you use them incorrectly, then you are arguably weak on logic	0
here is a valid argument: 1) all horses wear hats 2) ben is a horse 3) ben wears a hat	0
the above is valid	0
it is not sound	0

mattf you befriended a duck in 6.795 seconds! You have made friends with 695 ducks in #romanian.	0
meaning that if you accept the premise that all horses wear hats, the conclusion does logically follow	0
it is a valid argument	0
but not all horses wear hats, the premise is false, so the argument is not sound	0
it is a valid argument but not a sound argument	0

that book mentioned in the stackexchange question is actually the same book I learned from	0
it's a really nice book	0
that is the same book that goes with that Tarski's World program I told you about, mattf	0
it's a really nice package	0
hm	0
i see	0
even Leon Trotsky analyzed the A=A thing	0
it's similar to Coq	0
I think Trotsky said that A=A is not true	0
what :)	0
can't remember right now if he also used the word "tautology"	0
logics play an important part in Marxism, feral boy	0
lack of logics	0
the lack of it	0
:)	0
its all over the place yeah	0
Leon Trotsky developped dialectical logics a little further	0
not lack	0
Trotsky and Marx based themselves in the logics of Hegel	0
not easy shit	0
a serious Marxist, or Trotskyist, has to be very careful on the dialectical logic of their positions, arguments etc	0
attempts to implement communism only end up on dictatorships, poverty, people dying. Those regimes together killed much more than the nazi one	0
the A=A not being true is the core of Trotskyism	0
communism can't be "implemented", mattf 	0
shall we have this discussion for the sixth time? mattf 	0
yeah of course "my way will be the right one and we will do it right now"	0
they always say that then do the same thnig	0
I don't feel described by those words, mattf 	0
i know your thing is more like it has to come from the people	0
which one of you do i ban when the argument turns sour?	0
But look at Lula here, he came from the people	0
it is you who are calling those regimes 'communist', mattf, I assume you refer to Soviet Russia, present-day China etc.	0
you have to prove those regimes are communist	0
if you want to ban someone when you're losing the argument, that's definitely bringing in emotion	0
people who read Marx from the source are in prisons in China	0
i didnt ban you, did i?	0
gasconheart: well that peopel called themselves communists and liked marx 	0
no, but why would you ban anyone	0
i want to kick one of them for funsies	0
those people are free to call themselves whatever they want, mattf 	0
they sure are	0
but which one	0
no, that must never be done	0
it is not after their self-naming that I take them	0
being an OP should never be from emotion either	0
and you are saying they did it wrong and you know the right way	0
it should never be personal	0
even if the reason for the ban is that you are being personally attacked	0
mattf: I am not saying they "did it wrong"	0
it can be, you are saying they didn't even do it	0
in such a case, the reason for the ban would be that the OP is also a user and the user is being attacked	0
and i said it was an attempt to do it	0
but the OP as OP is operating from a position of detachment, like a judge	0
if one of them becomes disrespectful or insults, i do have the grounds to ban one of them. it will also be fun. is that ok now?	0
in a way, Soviet Russia, or present-day China, was/is just responding to the historic conditions that created them, nothing more	0
nobody is banning anyone for insults here	0
mattf: since 2015 we've had this conversation, identical, like 5 times now	0
that is acceptable, and not only acceptable, orangeFlu, but you have a duty to ban in such cases	0
or at least kick	0
perfect	0
in order to keep the peace of the room	0
gasconheart: it is not identical	0
gasconheart: we are not the same	0
mattf: don't you dare insult gasconheart.. *wink wink*	0
but if you personally want that to happen, then you must take care not to instigate the insults	0
i dont ever insult anyone do it 	0
i did no such thing	0
s/t$/?/	0
perfec?	0
what	0
because if you intentionally cause a situation simply to impose a kick or ban, then you are the one who should be kicked	0
how	0
s/it$/I ?/	0
in which case you would not be suitable as an OP	0
and i said it was an attempt to do I ?	0
which leads to a kind of "who shaves the barber" paradox	0
you realize i am joking now, right? i wouldnt kick either of them	0
yes of course, orangeFlu 	0
I hope there are no hard feelings here	0
i love that barber	0
I still have a sense of humor	0
if you are joking this isn't a logical debate and this is just mokeys throwing shit at each other	0
My point here was that there's no place for emotion in a logical argument	0
he shaves me every week because i cant shave myself	0
:)	0
but you can still have personal opinions and be emotional as a person	0
i agree	0
let's kick mattf 	0
yes kick me	0
mattf has an ~ though	0
it's like rock paper scissors	0
s/kick me/fuck you, orange	0
yes fuck you, orange	0
jesus, christ	0
~ beats @	0
that was uncalled for, mattf 	0
i recently came across an exploit on unrealircd that would let you drop into a reverse shell on the host machine	0
but thats long fixed	0
for example, if I were a Jewish police officer and thinking about the Holocaust made me sick to my stomach, but I saw a Nazi symapthizer being physically attacked by some other citizen for no reason, it would be my duty to protect the Nazi guy	0
but still creepy	0
creepy indeed	0
mattf: you insulted an op, prepare to meet your doom	0
but is he insulting the OP as OP or orangeFlu as a user	0
hmmmm	0
shouldnt matter	0
thats a bot	0
its a kick either way in my book	0
the bot is like an underage	0
ken: are you underage?	0
orangeFlu: No. Why do you ask? 	0
doesn't matter what they say	0
laws dont apply	0
ken: how old are you	0
well the bot is only a few years old	0
orangeFlu: I am older than you. 	0
i doubt that	0
cleverbot is old	0
older than 10 years?	0
still it is like you trying to ban a hammer	0
if i am a hammer, everything i see is a nail	0
you are a nail, mattf 	0
'I don't like hammers because you can kill people with it'	0
"ban the hammers!"	0
'Hammers dont kill people, people kill people"	0
exactly :)	0
they're trying to take away my right to open carry a hammer	0
outrageous 	0
the motherfucker	0
if I want to wear a hammer on my belt in the grocery store that's my right	0
what about my 3rd amendemenenanent or whatever	0

i learned a few days ago that we have a factory in romania that makes Kalashnikovs	0
now all these critical race theory people come in and try to take it away from us	0
and the workers are all women	0
weird	0
its like progressive... but not really	0
why, because they have better dexterity?	0
because they can pay them less i think	0
I went to Costa Rica one time and toured a coffee plantation, and they said they use all women to pick the beans	0
oh	0
or all the men are in management	0
the explanation there was that they have better finger control or something	0
women also tend to see colors better	0
that doesnt sound like a true statement, about the fingers. but the colors, yes	0
orangeFlu do you know about the radium clock girls	0
i think there is scientific merit to the second one	0
yes, of cours	0
poor women	0
girls	0
they were just high school kids	0
i mean, yes, clock go shiny in the dark, but damn	0
some of their jaws fell off	0
yeah it's a sad story	0
and that company knew the dangers also	0
they told them to lick the brushes to get a nice point	0
that's so fucked up	0
weird how so many experiences with radiation in that time were directed towards women. I mean, Marie Currie was a woman also	0
yeah but I think she's a bit different	0
but she didnt know the difference	0
she was obsessed with radiation	0
they still can't read some of her papers because the paper itself is too radioactive	0
i think she either thought it was safe or didnt fear it enough	0
her chair, door knob, everything that she regularly touched still is radiated	0
according to her kids she neglected her entire family to obsess over radiation at the lab	0
and can be measured today	0
I don't really know how much she knew about the danger, but she was definitely someone who was fixated on her topic	0
like a lot of academics	0
many of the top people in my field are divorced	0
my former boss got divorced	0
i mean, i think it was worth it because of what we know today, but whether it is morally acceptable or not, i cannot say	0

your former boss got dementia as well	0
yeah, and he is a colossal narcisisst	0
narcissist	0
narccississt	0
haha	0
that is one of those words I never get right	0
ubiquitous i never get right	0
and the other one is mnemonic, I can never remember how to spell it	0

I got mnemonic right this time	0
ironic	0

i also always stumble at definitely a bit	0
it takes me a while to remember	0
I can't think of any other English word that begins with 'mn'	0

mnone of those	0
it even looks weird on the computer screen	0
I don't like looking at it	0
mnemonist? one who makes mnemonics	0
that doesn't count, it's in the same family	0
they are all derived from the name of a Greek goddess	0
ah, yes, athena	0
I would be interested in seeing if Greek has any oher 'mn' words like that	0
the goddess of crime and sexual gratification	0
it seems strange even for Greek	0
haha	0
i dont know man, havent slept in forever	0
i only have microsleep now	0
like 10 minute naps	0
its the only way i can fall asleep since two days ago	0
right now i am trying to tire myself so i can sleep alright	0
i tried sleeping yesterday, gave up at four in the morning and started working	0
fell asleep at my desk during lunch hours	0
fell asleep again at like 8 or 9 for a few minutes and here i am	0
i am kinda worried	0
:)	0
that's bad for your brain	0
it can lead to brain plaques	0
brain paralysis 	0
I am about to go to sleep, I don't want brain plaques	0
i cant go to sleep	0
i am trying to drink warm milk and listen to the rain	0
but doesnt work	0
so i came here	0
but yes orangeFlu i have a brother	0
and my browser or nothing else than irc works right now	0
huh	0
we need a full irc browser	0
lets make it orangeFlu 	0
with rust or go	0
why did you mention your brother all of a sudden	0
am i having a stroke	0
i just did	0
you still dont know about him	0
i do, you told me about him a few hours ago	0
his existance	0
but why is he rellevant now	0
hes not	0
okay, i am not having a stroke then, good	0
he has some sort of cerebral paralysis 	0
really? why?	0
they never clearly figured it out	0
he was born like this	0
oh, i thought it was something recent that he developed	0
it might had to do with my parents being related, distant cousins	0
Godot	0
my parents didn't know that when they got together	0
so none of you guys watched Waiting for Godot yet?	0
but yeah	0
no	0
it's so great	0
how severe are we talking? on a scale from "i dont have much dexterity" to "i need help to poop"	0
he needs help to poop yeah	0
damn, sorry about that	0
what kind of operation is he having?	0
wheelchair, and he also doesn't understand  much of the world around them	0
him	0
hes able to say simple sentenecs	0
just like me	0
yeah	0
same	0

we literally call it bowl in portuguese	0
nice	0
interesting	0
anyway they will do something there to make his legs more open	0
im not sure what it is called	0
this is his 3rd surgery	0
i am very invested in this situation	0
yeah it is very hard for my mom	0
her life is taking care of him	0
so when the fuck do you all have time to tend to a farm?	0
you have a farm, a googolplex of cats and a disabled man to take care of	0
how old is he	0
i lived here my whole childhood	0
hes 17	0
he was born when i was 8	0
we moved to city when i was 12	0
and how old was he when he was born	0
because of him	0
and we are here 3 years now, since covide started	0
:)	0
where did you like it more, the city or here?	0
if you mean there	0
i would say here	0
here is something interesting I was reading recently	0
in Buddhist monastic law there are certain things that are limited by age,	0
it is really calm here, you guys have no idea	0
like what age you can become a monk	0
where are you right now?	0
seeing wild animals	0
but they account for time spent in the womb	0
yeah	0
no annoying things that happen in the city	0
so they add an extra 6 months to the time counted outside the womb	0
the problems are the bad internet and being far from everything	0
so you like it more on the farm?	0
handyc: why only 6?	0
they don't add a full 9 months because of something to do with accounting for premature babies	0
because someone could be born premature by a certain number of months	0
3 first months dont count, you are not alive then 	0
there were ... several cases of inbreeding in my family	0
how several?	0
orangeFlu: i really love it here	0
but before a certain number it's not considered possible for a premature baby to survive	0
i might be a special kid too :)	0
i think 6 is the agreed months before a baby could be viable, but even then..	0
I think the idea is that a baby gestating less than 7 months is not considered possible to survive	0
my great-grandparents were cousins :( And in their generation, there were two more couples of cousins	0
and so they add 6 months to account for both things	0
lungs very underdeveloped, you have to put him on steroids and whatnot, maybe dialisys	0
it sucks	0
when I went to Gascony to research in the Archives, things got worse	0
gasconheart: were them the last gascons :)	0
I discovered two more cases of inbreeding among my ancestors	0
did they want to keep the pure gascon race...	0
haha	0
https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0054.html	0
Title: Ordination | The Buddhist Monastic Code, Volumes I & II	0
like the targaryens?	0
there are Gascons in France nowadays!	0
unforgivable	0
"An applicant for full Acceptance must be at least twenty years old, counting from the time his consciousness first arose at conception in his mother’s womb. As this is difficult—if not impossible—to date with any accuracy, the usual practice in calculating a person’s age is to add six months to the number of years since his birth, to allow for his having been born prematurely. As the Commentary notes, a baby born after seven	0
 months in the womb may survive, but one born after only six months won’t."	0
so consciousness is when you can survive outside the womb?	0
interesting definition	0
seems reductive	0
yeah they sure just have their own defining and idea of the thing	0
no, I think consciousness arises when the sperm fertilizes the egg, in the traditional Buddhist reckoning	0
because that is when the mindstream enters	0
the mindstream is not the same as a soul because there is no soul in Buddhism	0
and where is that consciousness stored?	0
in the notocord?	0
it's some kind of free floating thing that is the karmic effect of the end of the previous life	0
oh i see	0
no, it's not stored, it floats around somehoe	0
somehow	0
.w notocord	0
(orangeFlu) Notochord :: In anatomy, the notochord is a flexible rod formed of a material similar to cartilage. If a species has a notochord at any stage of its life cycle, it is, by definition, a chordate. The notochord... :: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notochord	0
it is the soul conciousness 	0
and it sees people having sex and misses having a body	0
but not a soul	0
or they just gave another name to soul	0
yeah it's some kind of entangled consciousness thing	0
well they insist it's not the same as a soul	0
i lie that 	0
like	0
"and it sees people having sex and misses having a body" - i feel that everyday when i dont have anyone to have sex with	0
it's a collection of aggregates	0
I'm not saying this is what I believe, this is just how Buddhist texts traditionally explain things	0
I agree that it sounds pretty soul-like	0
i know	0
but it is different from a soul	0
i think there is some merit to the fact that the nothocord initally holds the consciousness if any. I will propose that to my biology teacher	0
because it's not something generated by a god or something,	0
it's like a bunch of ideas coming together and accidentally thinking they are a person	0
what i find cool about it is that conciousness arrives from something that is not stored in the body	0
interesting	0
so i hope on their definitions animals dont have conciousness ?	0
animals do have consciousness	0
if they have sex, they must	0
animals are one of 5 or 6 types of beings	0
do they have the soul thing?	0
what about fungi?	0
there are gods, anti-gods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts and hell beings	0
fungi would probably be either plants or animals in the Buddhist system	0
probably plants	0
yeah probably so	0
which i am guessing dont have consciousness	0
normally no	0
in some Mahāyāna texts everything has consciousness, even rocks I think	0
there are a couple books by Lambert Schmithausen	0
about the consciousness of plants in Buddhism	0
what do they consider something?	0
but I think this is not a mainstream idea	0
I don't understand your question	0
is a chair something? or the pieces of wood that form it separate something with separate consciousness. or their atoms	0
well a chair doesn't exist as a chair	0
things do not have something called intrinsic nature or svabhāva	0
this is a big deal in Indian philosophy	0
whether or not intrinsic nature exists	0
it's one reason there can't be a soul in Buddhism	0
because even the mindstream and the aggregates are not really what they seem to be	0
there is a famous story called the similar of the cart	0
thats too complicated for me to follow now	0
or the simile of the chariot	0
in a work called the Questions of King Milina	0
Milinda	0
or Menandeer	0
Menander	0
rocks with consciousness... that has become bullshit now :)	0
sorry	0
some Bactrian king I think	0
well consciousness is not the same as brain activity in Buddhism, mattf	0
yeah	0
i think it is the idea on neon genesis evangelion	0
I'm not saying this idea is true, but you have to read the texts to understand what they are actually trying to claim	0
i think its the idea of westworld	0
it may not sound as stupid as you assume	0
like the idea of original enlightenment	0
that we are all already enlightened but we sort of forgot	0
yeah i know	0
that is also not a mainstream view	0
it is just not the theory i was looking for	0
it is a special thing invented by the Japanese	0
mattf this is not the theory we wanted, it's the theory we deserve	0
is math invented or discovered?	0
but there are more	0
invented	0
both	0
debate	0
I would say more invented than discovered	0
well it is discovered in the sense that we have to interpret what the universe is doing, but that is our own interpretation	0
but the invention is not based on nothing	0
yeah	0
yeah	0
not much debate to be had here	0
i think im just in the same boat as handyc	0
i think most people are in the same boat here	0
regarding this	0
my wife wants to go on a cruise to BNorway	0
we can't prove that what we see is the reality, we can only be sure that it is the interpretation that makes sense for the human brani	0
Norway	0
she said she found one for half the normal price	0
you have too much trips	0
Why too much?	0
many	0
Why shouldn't I always travel?	0
Maybe I don't have enough trips	0
living in a boat, traveling around the world	0
How does one determine the proper amount of trips	0
i think the very fact that we had a bunch of axioms that could be false and different areas of math cant agree on a single set of them proves that we invented math	0
or in a van	0
it sounds cool	0
handyc: im just scared that tina will be like that and want to travel every month	0
:)	0
Not just that, but we can't even agree on what truth and falsity are and what they mean	0
yes	0
oh mattf I love it	0
my wife and I are a good match	0
maybe i learn to like it more	0
We both hate jewelry and stuff like that, and love food and traveling	0
who likes hewelr	0
mattf have you asked her about that kind of thing?	0
jewelry 	0
ugh	0
a lot of women love jewelry	0
im going to add a ban for that for this community	0
my mom has a shit ton of jewelry, like a whole room	0
mattf I'm talking about jewelry not jewry	0
hahahaha	0
tina likes to travel... i dont even need to ask	0
okay bad joke	0
oh	0
nazi joke	0
:)	0
did you not-see that coming, mattf?	0
no	0
mattf, this is a real thing	0
we went to this flower festival today	0
wast of money	0

Principia Mathematica tried to unite all of math and failed miserable so. Then I think Godel made the whole Godel numbers thing and proved the incompleteness of math	0

it didnt gail	0
fail	0
and the german one was this building with all these multimedia things about energy conservation	0
it is still useful to this day	0
like very	0
so thats not a fail	0
some of it is useful	0
and they have these energy conservation games for kids to play	0
what it ultimately tried to do failed	0
and when the kid goes in at the entrance he types his name into a computer, and so that they can register the scores on the games,	0
that doesn't matter, it is still the basis for so many things	0
they give them an armband to wear!	0
isn't that so german	0
oh god	0
this really happened	0
no way	0
:)	0
I really had to bite my tongue	0
like none of the other countries had this kind of display, only germany	0
very german indeed	0
and when you exit the display you drop your armband in a box and it computes your score	0
it was so fucking german	0
oh, so it had an accelerometer and some other stuff	0
it was some kind of smart band	0
what were the games like	0
I think the band just has a unique identifier	0
and then a central server remembers the score on that number	0
among other things, yeha	0
thats correct	0
they were like spin a wheel and learn about water conservation	0
did you guys see my new babies	0
you gave birth again mattf?	0
yes	0
with whom did you procreate?	0
to cats	0
with a female cat	0
fucking furries	0
:)	0
don't rush to conclusions, he may have been impregated by a feline god	0
well i dont have enough internet but i have a cat instagram linked on my blog	0
impregnated	0
it's a miracle	0
sad	0
mattf maybe your bad internet is a cosmic punishment for fucking that feline god	0
what if it was a lesbian cat	0
thats not supposed to happen. arent there proteins on an egg so interspecies stuff doesnt happen?	0
you can remove proteins with the right chemicals	0
so the sperm of that feline god had those enzymes	0
doesn't the metakarma thing floats around everywhere	0
presumably	0
I think the chromosome number would be wildly different though	0
this is a highly educated conversation, i love it	0
that's what is great about this place	0
we can be bawdy and also intelligent at the same time	0

too bad loudercake doesn't like philosophy	0
you guys should really watch waiting for godot	0
I'm not joking, it's seriously good	0
you should learn godot	0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q77jgal4Gto	0
I am learning Godot, man	0
what is the movie about	0
i mean, if you think about it, with the right hormones and stem cells, it is possible for mattf to have an uterus, eggs and a menstrual cycle	0
I already made some stuff, don't act like I'm not doing anything	0
:)	0
It's an existential play, mattf, it's basically about the futility of existence	0
oh god	0
it's really good	0
will make me more depressive	0
mattf: did you do some eugenics again, you smart boy	0
give it a chance	0
is it nihilist stuff	0
I don't think it's really nihilistic, no	0
but wont we make me think about nihilistic stuff	0
well it might make you think	0
but that's what the play is about also	0
im afraid of thinking	0
:)	0
thats a dangerous proposition, handyc 	0
it's a very thoughtful play	0
it's very complex	0
it's not just some shallow bullshit	0
it is not just some matrix	0
the matrix sucks	0
yeah	0
a better film from the same time is the 13th floor	0

which is a good amount of time	0
perfect, now you can watch westworld	0
ha ha	0
yeah maybe I should	0
I'm thinking of going down to the coffeeshop but I've been trying to cut back on that a bit	0
but if I watch something like that it might be nice to visit the coffeeshop first	0
the first step is a baseline interview. i am going to ask you a series of questions that will allow us to verify.	0
you seem to be saying pay my bill	0
no	0
you think I can get a torrent of westerworld	0
you need to ask "verify what?"	0

hey man, let me watch the shows how I like	0

oh nice	0
the park is just a ruse. they dont want to gratify guests at all. the purpose is not to let them fuck, kill, rape anybody and be 'free' or get to know themselves	0
hello, folks	0
Hi	0
they use the park as a way to let the guests be themselves when nebody is watching, but they are actually watching them very closely to see what decisions they make	0
so they can build maps of their brains	0
and then use that for marketing and manipulation	0
hi gasconheart, mattf	0
oh that makes a lot of sense	0
that's what I would have done if I ran an evil corporation	0
also, as a plus, they also try to map the human mind into hosts as a sort of immortality project, but thats a different project entirely	0
well, it does make a lot of sense, especially considering that most companies today do exactly that	0
but westworld is on another level altogether	0
yeah, it's a good metaphor for the current situation with facebook tracking and that stuff	0
yes	0
it's a very well thought out show	0
you will see	0
if you want, i can give you access to my torrent tracker	0
I'm making some improvements to my alignment engine as I prepare to feed it vinaya texts	0
I've often wondered how much I would need to add before it becomes a westworld	0
I have this supercomputing cluster account in Canada that is reasonably powerful	0
i know all about it, you told me before	0
But I don't have full access to the cluster, so it's basically like having a free souped up gaming PC that runs all the time	0
They just cut me off a slice with 32 cores and 32GB of RAM	0
but I don't have to pay anything to maintain it 	0
do you want the torrent tracker? it is romanian but very safe. been using it for 10 years, you can find pretty much whatever movie you want there and porn, games, whatever	0
I have it running on some of the texts from my last job right now, just to keep the processors active	0
because if I request that much and then they see I'm not using it, they may try to scale me back	0
so I want them to see that I am always using everything they give me	0
let me see if I can find it on my own first	0
okay	0
I will just use a VPN and see if I can find some random torrent	0
if not, dm me your mail and i will send you an invite	0
yeah, I forgot how much I explained this alignment thing to you already	0
I am just really excited about it	0
I feel like things are turning back around for me	0
be careful that the VPN supports P2P traffic, otherwise it is useless the moment you step out of the browser	0
For a while it seemed like I was blacklisted from academia	0
but it looks like the right people are watching what I do	0
can i have a look at the code?	0
is it documented?	0
sure	0
It's not well documented	0
thats okay	0
the code has a lot of sloppy stuff in it as well	0
did you do a baseline interview?	0
so you have to understand that much of it was written at a time when I was being threatened with termination constantly, and the code reflects that	0
to check for fidelity	0
but it seems to work pretty well, the basic idea at least	0
it's github.com/handyc and the repo is klurp	0
the important stuff is in /engine	0
the samplefiles stuff is some other experiments that are mostly not directly related to this text alignment problem	0
agent.py is the main file that is doing all the work	0
imagine if you wrote it in C++ or rust or even go. how fast it could be	0
population.py calls a population of multiple agents	0
and klurp.py calls population.py	0
I know it's not the "right" way to do it, but it was right at the time	0
yeah, i had my own genetic algorithms engine	0
yeah it could be much faster	0
oh nice	0
okay	0
that's really good to hear	0
it was for making programs though	0
many people seem to freak out when they hear about GAs for some reason	0
I don't really know why	0
not that you would freak out about it, but it's nice to know you were working on similar stuff	0
and i quickly discovered that evolutionary strategy works much better	0
than GA	0
what is the difference?	0
its less about the population and crossovers, more about more mutation and asexual reproduction	0
oh okay	0
I am not sure if I am really using these terms correctly at all	0
but it has been proved to perform better although the genetic pool is not as large i think	0
i forgetr	0
my GA or whatever it is is about as simple as it can be	0
my agents do have sex, though	0
right now they can all breed with each other but I was thinking about adding male and female variables	0
you can look at mine but i doubt you can understand anything from it, its written in lisp	0
I would like to learn lisp at some poinnt	0
but you can get some idea about how it works	0
in the DH world Python is king right now	0
that's mainly why I chose Python	0
I know it's not nearly as fast as it could be	0
this thing could certainly be optimized a lot better, but I was aiming more for readability	0
so that people can understand my code and reproduce my results	0
my program is nothing if not readable	0
just kidding	0
its a mess	0
If I can get the word out and also have it working well enough, this could be a really big deal in Buddhist Studies	0

Title: program-synth/genetic.lisp at master · Flu/program-synth · GitHub	0
look at this	0
this is the genetic part of the algorithm	0
and it is currently shit	0
probably always will be, i dont think i will go back to it to evolve it, although i would like that	0
its beautiful, nonetheless	0
i find lisp to be a very beautiful and elegant language	0
I don't know enough about Lisp to be able to tell between gold and shit	0
it does look elegant	0
anyway, God fucked around a lot when he made his genetic algorithm	0
i think everyhting you write in lisp can look elegant	0
if sloppy code is good enough for God then it's good enough for me	0
how about Haskell or OCaml, orangeFlu?	0
I am thinking about learning OCaml soon	0
well, kinda, he basically said, fuck efficiency, if it doesnt get old enough to procreate, it gets scraped, if it does, it is good enough	0
There's a big Sanskrit project I would like to work with that is already in that language	0

I am going to meet two of my former students for dinner next week and see if they have some ideas about it	0
One of my students just got into a PhD program for Digital Humanities	0
it's a new thing they just started at Leiden	0
I am so proud of him	0
He works on Korean stuff and also teaches Python	0
what does that mean	0
digital humanities	0
Digital Humanities is something that became trendy over the past 10 years	0
It's basically doing traditional humanities projects but applying computer stuff in some way	0
but it's not computer science	0
the focus is heavily on the humanities end	0
ALSO: my program is multi-threaded, so the sex happens simultaneuously, not in a linear way. I found this to be quite beneficial	0
yeah, I am using Python multiprocessing	0
My program is made to be able to use all available cores	0
it defaults to 75% core usage right now	0
be careful that you know the difference between multiprocessing and multithreading	0
each agent is its own process	0
different beasts	0
Yeah I do	0
or at least I think so	0
Python multithreading is not what I want	0
I read up on this a bit when I was first starting the design	0
Python multithreading is pretty useless for what I want to do	0
processes are slower, they have their own memory, communicate together with pipes and the likes. Threads are all in the same process, they have shared memory and are generally faster	0
yeah but as this thing grows I think multiprocessing is really the right choice	0
this is just the initial experiment	0
I will work on this thing the rest of my life	0
i will also work towards my goal for the rest of my life	0
but i will also rewatch westworld again and again	0
till the day i die	0

what?	0
how is endgame better than infinity war	0
i think as the movies age the scores lower	0
 	0
in what universe does that happen	0
i only care about the audience score	0
maybe the audience scores, but not the critics	0
ah, okay	0
yeah critics are just paid	0
thats why imdb is not that good	0
sometimes critics get it right but the audience is too dumb to recognize a masterpiece	0
yeah but idk	0
like westworld	0
if it is too damn hard to understand then it is niched	0
and i understand why you would say, it is not for everyone, so it is bad in average	0
and those scores are just averages, or they should be	0
at least	0
its not niched, but the average audience goes to the movie and has no fucking idea what they just saw, or they dont understad the meaning if its not full of mindless action	0
so they go to rt or imdb and give bad reviews	0
the average man is VERY dumb	0
like you have no idea	0
but the average man is the average man	0
and then think about the fact that half of all people are dumber than that	0
idk, it doesn't matter	0
debatable 	0
is like saying, people with degrees should have higher weights while voting on elections	0
and if you have a phd even higher	0
stuff like that	0
so either what matters is the average opinion and everyone is equally weighted or you have that sort of discrimination	0
mattf	0
I have done icecast redirects before	0
you just set up two icecast servers	0
oh rly	0
one sends out and one takes in	0
yes	0
actually not two icecasts	0
one icecast I think	0
well i would have to relay another stream, thats all	0
and just use mpd for both	0
yeah	0
yeah	0
i mean given some stream, make icecast relay it,	0
just receive on one mpd and send out with another	0
i actually think ive seen relay mounts on icecast	0
I can't remember exactly how I did it	0
this was years ago on my old show	0
but gascon  doesn't even care about it anymore	0
I used it to take the audio from my macbook and send it out through the raspberry pi	0
oh so you could have it on sdf and from sdf on your own radio?	0
I used it to pick up the microphone from my macbook, stream it to the rpi and then stream that to the anonradio server	0
oh	0
I probably have the settings file somewhere	0
but this was back when I was in canada and doing my other show	0
back in 2016	0
it did work	0
good old days	0
that regex the other day was amazing orangefly	0
flute	0
organflu	0
mattf here is a project I would like to do	0
organicfluid	0
lets see	0
I have this neighbor who is playing Arabian hiphop music really loudly at 9:00 in the morning	0
I asked him to stop and he told me to fuck off	0
gun	0
haha	0
they already invented it	0
its called gun	0
no, that would get me in a lot of trouble, we don't do guns in this country	0
what I want to do is this,	0
sniper rifle	0
spinner rifle	0
tell	0
make a very very directional speaker aimed right at him, that almost no one else can hear	0
and play back to him the same music he is playing, but with a random delay of 1/10th of a second to 1 second	0
and invert the waveform sometimes	0
so that his music sounds like shit	0
oh parallel sound waves	0
yeah but have a random variable so that it doesn't stick on any single thing	0
and just makes his music sound like total garbage	0
what is arabian rap	0
did you say that	0
it's rap music in Arabic	0
it sounds like shit	0
imagine some dumbass black guy playing really bad hiphop music	0
wait but can't the cops do anything	0
and replace the black guy with an Arabian guy	0
no, the cops won't do anything	0
the cops are useless for that kind of thing	0
the only way they will come is if he actively threatens violence	0
that is how I got the other guy kicked out when this happened before	0
oh how weird	0
I annoyed him until he threatened to beat me up, then I told the police my neighbor was threatening to beat me up and they sent like 8 guys all at once	0
oh i think its because at 9 am he is already allowed to do that	0
but when I complained about the noise they basically just hung up on me	0
yeah, there's not really a strict noise law here for individuals	0
I looked it up	0
damn	0
if it's between 8 am and 10 pm there is no actual rule	0
people can do whatever they like, it sucks	0
most Dutch people are nice enough that they won't fuck people over this way	0
but we get a lot of low class immigrants who don't care	0
especially in this neighborhood	0
There are crap directional speakers out there	0
https://www.amazon.com/Directional-Sound-Speaker/s?k=Directional+Sound+Speaker	0
Title: Amazon.com : Directional Sound Speaker	0
but you need something much more pwoerful	0
well he's two floors above me in the building opposite my backyard	0
he hangs out on his balcony looking over my backyard	0
he's really close	0
like I can stand by my fence and look him in the eye	0
he's like 20 feet away from me	0
so it wouldn't necessarily have to be very powerful at all	0
the building here are in a kind of circle	0
so the noise amplifies off all those buildings	0
well maybe you could do something like that	0
would be quite some work 	0
yeah I am thinking about it	0
sure, but these kinds of neighbors are everywhere	0
I have had this type of neighbor everywhere I have ever lived	0
in every country	0
maybe you could craft some device that you can point to a direction and it will relay the audio with some delay	0
and we could sell it as the "anti annoying music neighbor"	0
I was trying to figure out a way to hack his bluetooth connection	0
if he's connecting that way	0
sometimes there are ads and other things	0
oh maybe it is unpaid spotify or youtube	0
it sounds like he is streaming youtube from his phone to some kind of speaker system	0
yeah something like that	0
oh	0
so if I could somehow blow the speakers by sending a bad signal	0
I don't want it to be traceable back to me, though	0
idk, you have to confirm if it is even bluetooth	0
yeah, and when I search on my phone for open bluetooth devices there are like 50 things around here	0
go to your fence and check for bluetooth devices nearby... but you might be too far	0
because everybody has a smart tv now	0
oh	0
no there are really a ton og them	0
like literally 50 or maybe even more	0
you should make it directed	0
yeah	0
I am going to try a few experiments to narrow it down more	0
make a bowl of aluminum paper with a whole in a direction	0
:)	0
ha ha	0
something like that might work	0
well I have this old satellite dish on top of the shed, from the last neighbor	0
it's not hooked up to anything now	0
so I could swing that in the other direction facing exactly at this guy's balcony	0
but that would be super obvious	0
but it's also not illegal	0
I was also thinking of just coming out and dancing to the music and annoying him	0
hahaha	0
aren't other neighbors annoyed too	0
sometimes I am working in the garden while he does it and I will just talk really loudly and say things like, "wow, what kind of small dick poseur would play music this loud, some wannabe gangster?"	0
and sometimes that is enough that he goes back inside	0
all these people like this are total losers	0
yeah you would love brazil	0
they do it for attention 	0
ha ha	0
yeah I would end up murdering someone probably	0
here people mod their cars, make them very low and fill with amplifiers and audio boxes	0
whatever those things are called	0
and they go around blowing up	0
but they made laws for it here	0
so sometimes those guys go to jail	0
well my main weapon is psychology	0
my first job was in a place that would create those sound boxes and install them	0
those kinds of people want a certain type of attention	0
but if you give them a different type of attention they can't take it	0
yeah I hate those amplified bass cars	0
that is really bad for your ears	0
you can't even tell that you are destroying your ears when you hear it	0
it is always one of those short dick man	0
I think it does have a lot to do with that	0
have you ever seen this	0
short dick man, I do remember that song	0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4qU6t1ZH24	0
with kids	0
oh yeah	0
I do remember you sharing that gem with me	0
hahaha	0
how can that singer come and dance for kids with that thing playing	0
:)	0
I was reading an article about penis size recently	0
and about what women imagine the average dick length to be	0
and what men imagine it to be	0
and what the actual average is	0
oh	0
and what the average porn dick is	0
yes?	0
yeah, let me see if I can find it	0
basically men think the average is much longer than it is	0
and so do women, but women think the average is smaller than what men think	0
and porn dicks	0
porn dicks are actually small, is just the camera angle	0
:)	0
not according to this study	0
it said the average porn dick was like 7 inches	0
but the average dick overall was something like 5 inches I think	0
and women thought the average was something like 5.8 inches	0
men thought it was 6 inches	0
if I recall correctly	0
I think this was posted on hacker news in the past week	0
I am trying to find it but when I type "average penis size article" I get a ton of stuff	0

so I got annoyed, I said it's already in a safe place	0
then she got annoyed and said, "Why do you talk this way!?"	0
because if I show any kind of negative emotion in my voice it is not acceptable to her	0
I said I talk this way because you are coming into my office at one o clock in the morning and obsessing over a keyboard warranty card	0
that's why I say she has her head way up her ass, mattf	0
so now she is angry again	0
the warranty card is not even useful for anything	0
what am I going to do if my cheap Chinese keyboard breaks, mail it back to China for repairs?	0
She just likes to come and tell me what to do	0
it's irritating	0

I watched waiting for godot	0
oh really!?	0
the whole thing?	0
mattf how did you manage?	0
Yes	0
wow man, you really have the stamina	0
I am impressed	0
So it is an allegory	0
I gues what is what they call it	0
yeah	0
that's right	0
it's a metaphor for the human condition	0
About waiting for death or waiting for happiness, while living a routine life	0
yeah	0
you got it	0
With some comic events	0
and the frustration of ordinary things	0
yes it has a lot of comedy	0
there are many hidden messages	0
I did t expect his pants to just fall in the end	0
hahaha	0
But I think it is pretty abstract, the message isn’t absolutely clear. It is subject	0
Subjective	0
There could be other interpretations	0
I had forgotten about the pants	0
well a lot has been written about this play	0
there have been a billion articles written about what he meant for it to be saying	0
people even argue about the correct pronunciation of Godot	0
Only thing I’m sure is that threw my were wearing hats	0
why did that throw you?	0
they are supposed to be two gentlemen who have fallen on hard times	0
Oh mobile correction madness	0
That I’m sure****	0
I started watching Westworld, it's really good	0
I’m only really sure that they are wearing hats	0
much less boring than Waiting for Godot	0
Yeah	0
oh I see what you are saying, yes	0
At some parts it was hard to wait for waiting for Godoy to end :)	0
yeah	0
I never claimed it was extremely entertaining, just that it's a brilliant play and worth watching	0
it's kind of painful to sit through it	0
Have you watched a movie “the platform”	0
no	0
It is a less boring one but less subjective but also a modern allegory about the human coronation I guess you could also say	0

then i would have more time to work	0
on my projects	0
and eventually get my job	0
whiteout, do you mean a daydream?	0
but i cant do that now because im waiting for godot	0
mattf this westworld is really good	0
what is it about	0
you should watch it and then maybe you could make a mattf westworld	0
it is on my watchnext list	0
it's a theme park based on the wild west	0
where all the characters are androids	0
i like the old wild west	0
and rich people visit and live out their fantasies	0
but then the androids start to become sentient	0
i learned to play the "the wild ugly and bad" (or smt like that) theme one day and made that .duel thing on the other day	0
it's kind of like The Matrix except that the characters are actually made of matter	0
i see	0
like detroid game	0
revolution of robots	0
like "I robot"	0
the good the bad and the ugly	0
yes	0
that's one of the most famous spaghetti westerns	0
yeah	0
it is the most famous	0
an excellent movie	0
yeah and there are two more	0
it's a trilogy	0
I actually like a fistful of dollars more	0
ive watched them	0
this is very similar	0
i dont think i know that one	0
guests come to this park and they have to dress in wild west clothes	0
but idk, the names in portuguese are all diffeernt	0
i see	0
and the androids don't know they are androids, they think they are in the actual wild west	0
awesome	0
so the guests can kill them and have sex with them and stuff	0
but the androids can't hurt any humans	0
but of course everything goes wrong and then they do start hurting the humans	0
yeah i saw that comming	0
well it is on my list so yeah	0
yeah but it's very complex	0
can't start watching it now 	0
im waiting for godot	0
it was on my list also but now that I started watching I can't stop	0
I'm really happy that you saw Waiting for Godot	0
hah	0
i did	0
it makes me inspired to finish my donuts	0
Maybe we can work together after all	0
waiting for godot can be also interpreted as the excuse do not do now what you should be doing now, like we wait our whole life willing to do dreams we never do because we are waiting for something that can never be done to be done	0
so you want to automate your conversations with tina,	0
not really	0
like you would use the bot instead of you talking to her?	0
that would be pretty cruel	0
would be interesting to try to do that	0
just to see how it goes	0
what if she is actually super good at programming and already did that to you	0
but not really do it	0
could be	0
that would be pretty creepy	0
and then you go and visit her and it's some old man	0
Ive seen her live in video call	0
was that deep fake	0
or you go to the address of her house but it's actually just some AI company	0
in this day and age it's hard to tell	0
yeah 	0
but it was in 2016	0
when i met her	0
AI wasn't that good then	0
there are even deepfakes videos now that will apply proper screen reflection to the deepfake to simulate light from the screen on your face	0
the deep fake stuff is getting pretty creepy	0
you can find porn with any famous actress you want, video	0
yeah we're crossing over some threshold soon	0
oh really?	0
yeah man	0
search for it	0
:)	0
I have seen some of those Tom Cruise fakes	0
I didn't know it was already being done with porn	0
seems like a logical next step	0
oh hahaha	0
there are of course a lot of ethical and legal implications	0
there are sites just for deep fake porn already	0
someone will surely put a kid's face on that stuff	0
and then it will be a big question about whether or not that is child pornography	0
this has already become a problem with people making porn of The Simpsons and stuff like that	0
oh thats a huge debate	0
like a video of someone having sex with Lisa Simpson, should it be legal	0
there has been many "porn" animations with characters that look underage	0
japanese love doing that	0
they call it lolicon 	0
yeah, it's not an easy issue to resolve	0
right	0
and now you can get real sex robots	0
you can get a sex robot of a kid	0
yes sex dolls	0
that look underage	0
sex dolls but I think they are becoming sex robots now	0
creepy	0
this is why philosophy is still important	0
it will always be	0
yeah but a lot of people don't understand what it's for	0
it comes before math	0
right	0
it is the basis of human thought 	0
yeah, I agree, it's like the study of wonder	0
wonder is what leads to abstract thinking	0
people think it is just some boring thing, like sociology :)))	0
so the girl left	0
i am alone now	0
Well I think a lot of people imagine it's just people sitting around and sharing their opinions	0
hi orangeFlu 	0

and i am not prepared for that	0
nice, what did you think?	0
it's awesome, man	0
thanks for suggesting this to me	0
i know :))	0
you are welcome	0
this is the best thing I've seen in a really long time	0
the fact that it takes me on average a few months to convinve a single person to watch this show is beyond my understanding	0
I had only seen some teasers before, I thought I knew pretty much what it was from reading the plot summaries, but this is so well done	0
because your taste in media is so varied	0
You also told me Avengers was good	0
It's OKAY	0
not good	0
Hahahahahaha	0
hey mattf, chen was here earlier	0
who is chen	0
is that your Chinese friend?	0
oh	0
idk	0
I thought that was the Chinese guy	0
could have been	0
infinity war is good, but you need to have watched every single movie from marvel from before to get why	0
nah :)	0
He/she came in a couple times today for about 1 minute	0
but didn't say anything	0
I wasn't here, I just saw it in the log	0
Yang Chen-Ling?	0
i see	0
well he didn't say nothing to me	0
I used to enjoy those X-Men movies but the last few Marvel movies I've seen I did not like at all	0
thats fair	0
which were the last marvel ones you watched handyc	0
I'm really not a fan of heavy use of CGI	0
but westworld is not on the same level, not even in the same fucking universe	0
Well I saw both Deadpool movies, I enjoyed those	0
those are great	0
yeah, those are good	0
I saw some of Infinity War on an airplane and I had to shut it off	0
the MCU until endgame was pretty cool	0
after disney plus it... is getting bad	0
The last X-Men I saw was the one where Wolverine goes back in time	0
I think that movie is Wolverine	0
have you seen logan	0
It took me some time to understand that not everyone is going to like the careful but sometimes honestly dumb things marvel has done up to endgame	0
No, is it good?	0
Logan is also fuckng great	0
Logan is great	0
okay I will check it out	0
R-rated 	0
very violent	0
Wolverine is probably my favorite character	0
It's about wolverine when he gets old	0
Yeah that actor was also the best wolverine we will get ever :)	0
in a post apocalytic world	0
yeah	0
yes!!	0
when they bring the x man in the mcu is going to be weird	0
Is that Benedict Cucumber	0
well they kinda did	0
no	0
hahaha	0
oh they have a new one now?	0
Heath Ledger was the best Joker	0
i think in the last doctor strange they met professor X of another universe hahah	0
I don't know much about Dr. Strange	0
He's a surgeon who hurts his hands and goes to a Buddhist temple and becomes magical?	0
handyc: you are also going to notice some inconsistencies in westworld. Every time you do, i promise you, it is intentional because of the non linear story telling they do. Mashing multiple timelines and not telling you which one every scene is in. And usually by the end of the season, they explain everything	0
handyc: bascially yeah	0
Yeah I believe you, orangeFlu 	0
idk if the temple is buddhist per se	0
but he goes to katmandu	0
You don't have to convince me to keep watching this	0
he is bit by a radioative buddhist temple and becomes a super hero	0
okay :)) force of habit	0
I understand	0
but I'm sold on this one	0
I will torrent all of them	0
.blb westworld	0
(mattf) No results found	0
idk if blb is still working	0
what is blb	0
oh, this night season 4 episode 5 appears, i am very excited	0
wonder if i should stay awake	0
nice	0
.blb 	0
I have a torrent of seasons 1-3	0
I didn't grab them all yet but I have the torrent file	0
I got all of season one and half of season 2	0
you either wait until season 4 is through and then download the whole season or download each episode individually. nobody is doing packs for half a season	0
so tomorrow is episode 5, there are 3 more after that, so 3 weeks from tomorrow season 4 is all done	0
I will probably just wait	0
It will take me a little while to get through 3 seasons	0
Did I tell you about this journal that contact me?	0
season 3 has only 8 episodes	0
Yeah I did	0
you did	0
They are giving me until March to give them an article draft but that time will go quickly	0
I need to make sure this alignment engine generates some quality results on arbitrary texts	0
seems pretty generous to me	0
This is suddenly becoming a real thing	0
Yeah it's a good journal, too	0
a lot of big bulls are in it	0
Chen?	0
he is a big bull	0
I don't know who Chen is	0
the chinese guy from earlier	0
But a bunch of the top Buddhist law scholars are on the board	0
Yeah, I don't know him	0
you will become one yourself	0
trust	0
Yeah maybe	0
but I need to up my language skills a lot	0
It's a good incentive	0
I could do all that stuff if I really stuck with it	0
but a lot of what those people do I find very boring and dry	0
Well, you are trying to learn dutch, sanskrit, latin and god knows what other languages you need at the same time, no one is blaming you if you think its hard and takes a long time	0
Tibetan and Classical Chinese	0
and also Pali	0
Latin not so much	0
Japanese and German are good to know also for secondary scholarship	0
but here's the thing orangeFlu 	0
tibetan is the one with the 1500 year old writing system that has no connection to how they talk?	0
they do blame me for not knowing those things	0
People in that field can be super mean	0
i think academics in all fields are	0
Even when I submitted my toilets article, I thought I would be the only person writing about toilets	0
because its super competitive	0
and then the reviews came back and I had to do a lot more research	0
because they wrote stuff like, "Oh I see you didn't mention this brief paragraph on toilets from an article in this obscure Indian journal from 1973"	0
also because usually people in academia have an ego the size of an elephant	0
yeah	0
My old boss had me sit in on Sanskrit classes when I was doing that last job	0
and he would make monkey noises at me when I messed up a word	0
it was really intimidating	0
that guy is a special kind of asshole, though	0
I know how these people operate now, though	0
I know all their secrets	0
I know how to study on my own now	0
I have seen the top of the mountain	0
So it's just a matter of applying myself	0
I have all the tools I need	0
and now I am the one building the tools	0
and the top people doing Buddhism and computer stuff already know who I am	0
so no excuses for me anymore, I will learn Tibetan and I will learn to make donuts	0
Be careful, Christian. You can't play God without being acquainted with the devil.	0
yeah but I *am* the devil	0
imagine if bernard responded with this	0
haha	0
is Christian supposed to be me? I'm Christopher	0
Oh, shit, forgot	0
that's okay	0
You should hear what Chinese people call me	0
and here i thought i was really clever because Christian and Jesus	0
Multiple Chinese people have accidentally addressed me as Christ	0
and the quote worked on another level	0
well I got the reference anyway	0
because I watch westworld	0
but mattf is missing out	0
haha, quick, make some joke about Dolores 	0
make him feel bad	0
I looked at what you said and I saw nothing at all	0
it looked like nothing to me	0
You're saying it doesnt look like anything to you?	0
yesss	0
hahahaha	0
But seriously, there are a ton of these digital projects for Buddhism where people make the same lame mistakes over and over and over	0
I really think I can make a better Buddhism dictionary on my own	0
so many projects with good intentions that just totally miss the mark on very basic things	0
digital siloism is a huge problem	0
projects that want to keep all the data and make you register an account	0
and then the whole project shuts down when the funding runs out, and just disappears	0
or they keep it running but it turns into a bunch of dead links	0
that will not happen with my project	0
because I will give out all the code	0
people will be able to host their own version	0
sounds like what you need is a blockchain	0
oh yes, blockchain everything	0
immutable, permanent, backed-up in so many places it's almost impossible to delete	0
we will get the energy from Second Earth	0
i use blockchain for my daily poop	0
and wouldnt you know it	0
i got rich by pooping at home	0
I use two factor authentication on my toilet so it can be sure it's really me	0
and you can do that too	0
My new app is called Toilety	0
It's free for the first 30 shits	0
30???	0
man, thats like a few years worth of poops for some people	0
if you hold it in and poop like 3 weeks, it is almost 2 years of poops	0

if you give me monty python.. i swear to god..	0
oh	0
okay	0
i will watch it a bit later, trying to do some rust now	0
https://youtu.be/0gnnFVRlucg	0
cause i forgot all my rust	0
yeah I understand	0
in the few weeks i didnt do anything with it	0
so you got a bit rusty	0
and now i dont know why my 2 numbers are not adding up	0
yes.................... i got rusty	0
did you try using a blockchain	0
I heard there's an app for it	0
called number adderly	0
surprisingly, i did	0
but i couldnt get the hash function right	0
orangeFlu a good way to make an app popular is to add -ly to the end	0
the rest of the implementation was done okay	0
but the hash function i cant do because it presumes i know how to add two numbers in rust	0
which i dont	0
Rustily	0
so i am prevented from solving my problem in a recursive manner	0
The only number adding app that delivers fresh bananas right to your house	0
i think i just understood lisp	0
Our patented blockchain technology adds ANY two numbers and delivers fresh bananas right to your house	0
Even imaginary numbers? Yes	0
Even large numbers? Yes	0
Start using Number Bananaly now	0
Your first ten numbers are free	0
then pay a small fee of only $20 each month	0
for unlimited number adding	0
no, you should pay in crypto	0
and fresh bananas delivered right to your house	0
you pay BananaCoin to add numbers	0
I had this idea for a new cryptocurrency that will solve economic inequality	0
It's called RandoCoin	0
and then some motherfucker is going to add graham's number with a googolplex	0
Your coins are worth a random amount every time you check	0
hahahahah	0
thats good	0
thanks, maybe I should actually make it	0
but how is that different from normal crypto?	0
cause it fluctuates all the time	0
Well one way it is the same is that I will dupe a lot of people into buying it and then flee the country	0
aaa, a pump-and-dump	0
i know those, i do that with girls	0
oh are you a playa?	0
I am so glad I don't need to date anymore	0
Marriage is very convenient	0
pounce and bounce	0
hit it and quit it	0
I never really did that	0
Ejac and evac	0
hahaha	0
I like that one	0
blow my load and hit the road	0
shoot and scoot	0
nail and bail	0
smash and dash	0
slip and slide	0
Nutella & go -- which is an actual product	0
splooge and luge	0
i saw it in a supermarket today	0
I don't like Nutella, never did, it's way too sweet	0
while i was with a girl	0
the girl	0
I don't understand Nutella and I don't understand mixing tobacco with weed, Europeans are weird	0
and i pointed to it and said: thats what we did, right?	0
get it?	0
yeah	0
sorry, someone said my name in the Buddhism chat	0
my loyal ox	0
another blackout	0
mattf	0
.dict blackout	0
(handyc) blackout: A cutoff of electric power, especially as a result of a shortage, a mechanical failure, or overuse by consumers. - https://is.gd/oLNbcC (AHD/Wordnik)	0
no not that one	0
thats what i had	0
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackout_(drug-related_amnesia)	0
Title: Blackout (drug-related amnesia) - Wikipedia	0
oh	0
that i dont have	0
I thought you were talking about a mental condition	0
?	0
when you said blackout earlier I thought you meant a daydream	0
because you mentioned making a bot to fool tina	0
i thought i was talking about the mental blackout and send me the wikipedia link about the same thing i was talking abuot?	0
I misunderstoof	0
misunderstood	0
so I thought you were using the word blackout in the wrong sense	0
then I linked wikipedia thinking it would give the mental blackout as the first article	0
i had a blackout	0
thats racist	0
lets say it was a whiteout	0
handyc i wanted to turn myself into a bot based on my telegram conversation to automated chatting with tina"	0
the context in which you said the above made it sound like you yourself had the blackout	0
and then you said whiteout	0
so it sounded like some mattfism for "daydream"	0
because usually if someone says "I had a blackout" it would be in the context of drinking so much you can't remember what happened	0
that is why I was confused	0
I guess if I were talking about a power outage I would probably say "We had a blackout here"	0
or just "our power went out"	0
if it happens for only a few seconds we call it a brownout	0
I still don't know what you meant by "whiteout"	0
oh because of the race thing	0
but switching it to the opposite race doesn't make it less racist	0
so probably just call it a Mexican out	0
then everyone is happy	0
glad I could help you with this	0
this ticket is now closed	0
it looks like you are typing a letter	0
it sounds like you are saying pay my bill	0
another blackout	0
i just though why black handyc	0
and realized it was racist	0
so from now on im calling it a whiteout	0
oh	0
you're having power outtages there?	0
mattf here's the thing	0
@pt you're having power outtages there?	0
Você está tendo falta de energia lá? 	0
yeah	0
lame	0
very good translation	0
 \o/	0
not rly	0
HOORAH!	0
if you are worried about offending black people by using the word black then you shouldn't call black people black that's racist	0
so you should call black people white	0
then everyone will be happy	0
yeah	0
and white people black	0
hm it makes sense	0
no call everyone white	0
because historical debt	0
sure, why not	0
to make up for the past shit	0
yeah	0
yeah	0
whiteout	0
do you guys know anything about OCaml?	0
so if you hear a black person talking about black rights you ought to correct them and tell them that's not appropriate language anymore	0
and tell them they are white	0
gasconheart: wowies!!1	0
they will be happy you understand their culture	0
wow gasconheart 	0
getting on the OCaml train	0
gasconheart: very unexpected	0
let's make this room into an OCaml room	0
there was a guy asking about OCaml in a Romanian chat	0
wasn't coq similar to ocaml	0
should I call him here?	0
gasconheart I've been meaning to learn OCaml, it's great	0
Yeah	0
ofc	0
we dont know nothing about ocalm	0
o calm donw	0
Yeah I don't know much of anything about it yet but I have been meaning to, it's on my list	0
but we have .w	0
.w ocalm	0
(mattf) No results found.	0
oh god	0
.w ocaml	0
(mattf) OCaml :: OCaml is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language which extends the Caml dialect of ML with object-oriented features. OCaml was created in 1996 by Xavier Leroy, Jérôme Vouillon, Damien... :: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml	0
Professor Xavier did it	0
orangeFlu wants to learn OCaml also	0
Xavier Leroy, cool name	0
He's probably white	0
is ocaml that one that was similar to coq	0
he seems to be afk, I dm'ed him, left a message	0
i know is the one for google drive filesystem thing	0
Xavierbot hahahah	0
https://people.redhat.com/~rjones/xavierbot/	0
Title: Xavierbot - an OCaml toplevel for IRC	0
nice	0
lisp is cooler	0
well okay	0
well except lisp isn't a language	0
but I want to learn OCaml specifically because I have a project in mind that I would like to extend	0
no, but common lisp is	0
https://gitlab.inria.fr/huet/Heritage_Resources	0
Title: Gérard Huet / Heritage_Resources · GitLab	0
and all lisps are pretty similar, maybe except for scheme	0
clojure is on my list	0
https://gitlab.inria.fr/huet/Zen/-/tree/master	0
Title: Files · master · Gérard Huet / Zen · GitLab	0
what is OCaml specifically good for	0
handyc	0
this would be good for other languages too	0
well it's a functional language mattf	0
it's a general purpose functional language in the ML family of languages	0
.w ML languages	0

mattf it's basically a language for making languages	0
yeah but what is special	0
oh	0
I'm not sure what is so special about OCaml specifically	0
maybe just a popular variant that caught on	0
i like that the funcion declaration syntax is "fun"	0
thats motivating	0
im sold	0
Well I like that I keep hearing about OCaml every week or so for some reason	0
so it seems to be getting increasingly popular	0
and it seems like a great choice for doing linguistics experiments	0
and also because this other Sanskrit project is already using it	0
oh yes OCalm is the langauge used to make Coq	0
and that guy will probably die soon	0
so it would be nice to extend his work and carry it on	0
otherwise someone might just lose all that code	0
oh yeah now I remember you mentioning that to me before	0
coq is hard	0
you like hard coq?	0
I still didn't have a chance to look into coq at all	0
it looks like something very useful though	0
as I mentioned before, I would like to remake Tarski's World as an open source project	0
That would be a nice Godot project	0
You could do proofs on your phone	0
mattf make a Coq<->Godot library	0
handyc ok, hel me to finish girrcc	0
:gh girc	0
https://github.com/matheusfillipe/gircc 	0
Title: GitHub - matheusfillipe/gircc: Godot irc client	0
since loudercake died you should take his place	0
okay	0
yeah I can do that	0
but I am not going to be as whiny as he is, is that okay?	0
as he *was* I meant to say	0
he didn't seem interested anyway	0
since he died	0
yeah	0
ok good	0
I'm very interested in Godot IRC	0
thats not a bad project handyc	0
it's a great idea	0
and we already have the basis there	0
websocket client, tcp without ssl and tcp with ssl	0
basic commands	0
yeah	0
it is all there	0
did you ever try it out	0
clone that repo and check it	0
the UI is currently the worst part of it	0
didn't I test some of this for you?	0
but I didn't do much with it	0
I think I tested an early version briefly	0
idk, make sure you learn git and get the latest commit	0
:)	0
anyway yes I will help with it, it's a great idea	0
there isn't any godot irc project out there	0
yes it is good for getting me up to speed with both git and Godot and also with IRC stuff	0
or is there	0
:s godot irc	0

ha	0
more than 5 years dont count	0
well why not one more	0
no no look at what those are	0
it doesn't matter anyway	0
I can't see it, the link cut off	0
oh the first one is irc for twitch	0
gift	0
thats mantained and cool	0
what is the Duri.... one	0
twitch chat uses irc	0
https://github.com/drtwisted/godot-twicil this is chat for godot that supports twitch	0
Title: GitHub - drtwisted/godot-twicil: Godot TwiCIL – Godot Twitch Chat Interaction Layer	0
nother twitch one	0
oh I don't know anything about Twitch, okay	0
these twitch ones are using websockets i suppose	0
and not raw tcp	0
my lib defaults to websocket on the web build	0
twitch chats?	0
twitch chat uses IRC	0
https://github.com/Timofffee/GodotIRC ok this was an actual irc client for godot	0
I'm talking to this guy now	0
Title: GitHub - Timofffee/GodotIRC: IRC client on Godot engine	0
yeah	0
it looks quite like mine does now	0
but it is already a godot plugin, whcih is what i want to do with this project handyc	0
it is just too old and abandoned	0
but save that one	0
another twitch one	0
a irc bot: https://github.com/AlexHoratio/GodotIRC	0
Title: GitHub - AlexHoratio/GodotIRC: An IRC client in Godot, based on code from https://github.com/TheDuri ... [trunc]	0
in godot	0
https://github.com/AlexHoratio/GodotIRC my project	0
Title: GitHub - AlexHoratio/GodotIRC: An IRC client in Godot, based on code from https://github.com/TheDuri ... [trunc]	0
no	0
https://github.com/matheusfillipe/gircc	0
Title: GitHub - matheusfillipe/gircc: Godot irc client	0
oh that one is based on the other one	0
okay	0
not that willing to come here, it seems	0
the others are not actually irc	0
and 9 yeras old	0
handyc so there isn't much indeed	0
s/that willing/cool enough	0
not cool enough to come here, it seems	0
yeah mattf let's do it, I'm in	0
I will take a close look at that code this week	0
there is only one that is actually a general purpose irc plugin	0
I am going to add some things to my jam game also	0
but abandoned since 2017	0
the twich one first result is still mantained	0
abandoned, great	0
yeah but that's twitch specific, so don't worry about iut	0
it	0
but we are problem the only guys doing a general irc client for godot that will support godot 4!	0
im digging gifts code	0
websocket!	0
no tcp at all	0
yeah	0
makes sense, twitch might not serve on tcp at all like other irc servers because it is a website anyway	0
mattf stop obsessing over what other people did	0
so these twitch ones might not care about tcp and tcp + ssl	0
you already convinced me	0
im not trying to convince you	0
im giving you the situation status	0
okay	0
if you want to help me get the thing and try to create more commands and improve the ui	0
main.gd is the UI and script for the main.tscn scene	0
the irc folder contains the *Backend scripts that implement the tcp, tcpS (tcp + ssl) and webssocket interfaces which basically have a send and receive signal and convert everything to strings	0
and the actual Ircclient is irc/ircCliend.gd	0
okay I will	0
what do you really think happened to loudercake 	0
at the bottom of this file, after like 407 there are methods for classical irc commands such as join, mode, topic, etc	0
is he just busy with school?	0
did we scare him off somehow?	0
i have no idea	0
he seemed to be making rapid progress with godot	0
irc ircs ws and wss	0
then we did that unborn stuff together and he disappeared	0
he started his game for the last jam	0
then gave up	0
and disappeared	0
yeah he showed me some art, it looked nice	0
I hope he keeps at it	0
it's so easy to get discouraged	0
i have left some # louercake TODO	0
over the files	0
you can take them as # handyc TODO	0
ha okay	0
hello	0
nice	0
hi	0
what is that	0
what's what	0
oh it is you	0
I'm a subtle cake	0
:)	0
I'm not loud	0
good	0
haha	0
haha	0
s/haha/haha	0
haha	0
oh this is saying I am now known as a handyc...	0
bad thing	0
let me see 	0
there can be only one handyc	0
so the events of nick changing are similar	0
i have to know if it was either me or you	0
I changed my nick and changed it back	0
but that should not have affected you	0
hi testman	0
hi josdfa	0
ok got it	0
testman is me using netca as an irc client	0
okay	0
s/ca/cat	0
testman is me using netcat as an irc client	0
you should try that out	0
s/netca/my dick	0
testman is me using my dick as an irc client	0
oh try it now?	0
okay I can try it quickly	0
it's midnight though	0
my wife will come in any minute and tell me my room is a mess	0
and then she will tell me I'm up too late	0
we will have a brief argument and then she will go to sleep	0
it's kind of like westworld	0
we have a script we follow	0
then she shoots me	0
I wake up the next day like nothing happened	0
handyc: 	0
hello	0
oh hi	0
i am handyc	0
i see	0
okay this works	0
no wait	0
just a bug 	0
it said I am now know as worls	0
mattf to works is displayed as you	0
works	0
thats the bug im fixing	0
yeah same problem you had	0
okay	0
no problem	0
looks cool	0
yeah it works	0
it has a /help	0
but the ui sucks	0
this has a lot of potential for something really great	0
and many commands missing	0
yeah well that can be improved in time	0
it can become a irc client	0
and a irc plugin	0
it's already super cool	0
so you can easy add chats to games	0
yeah I like it	0
also when you join a new room	0
it doesn't have like tabs	0
well that stuff can all be addeed	0
this is great	0
but join and part is already implemented	0
I do remember testing before	0
also name coloring 	0
many things could be done	0
url highlight	0
image preview	0
when I downloaded it just now there was already one version in the downloads folder	0
basic doing the same stuff im doing in the flutter app there	0
sure but those are details	0
I will take a close look at the code starting tomorrow and find the TODOs	0
now is not a great time	0
ok	0
a cat just came in	0
:)	0
he wants food or something	0
or he wants me to let him out the front	0
remember to pull the latest and start your own branch	0
git checkout -b ui-improvements	0
okay	0
will do	0
you run git pull before that because maybe i already have that issue fixed	0
but doesn't matter too much if you dont update first anyway	0
but is good if you do in work another branch	0
okay	0
brb	0
well it is a design problems, events should all have a source...	0
i learned a bit more abotu irc while doing this unreal plugin	0
also there is a big TODO in the readme handyc	0
ill add more to it	0
mattf: how well do you know rust?	0
this fat pig cat wanted some food	0
and then he wanted to go explore the night	0
okay I will check out all the TODOs mattf	0
mattf: i know you are there, probably eating or something	0
on a second thought, i am going to go and eat something	0
orangeFlu: I finished reading the rust book about one year ago	0
then i read some of the "learn rust by example"	0
and i did many challenges n that site	0
that site was cool, 	0
oh this	0
https://www.codewars.com/kata/	0
Title: Kata Practice | Codewars	0
then i started trying to find an actual rust project i could do 	0
:gh mangle	0
https://github.com/matheusfillipe/mangle 	0
Title: GitHub - matheusfillipe/mangle: Exolang that can take any utf8 text as valid code and return some re ... [trunc]	0
but is is abandoned for now	0
i found this site which is pretty cool	0
https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises	0
Title: Rust on Exercism	0
then i decided i should learn go first because i still dont know rust at all and it is too hard, and i learned go in less than 2 weeks and already have many PR's and some proejcts with it :)	0
and go actually has paid jobs out there	0
but i still want to learn rust	0
that Audio project i showed you some days ago was a serious idea orangeFlu 	0
what audio project	0
i think rust has a very bright future	0
i seriously forgot about it	0
idk why google is comming with carbon	0
while they say "just go use rust" on their readme	0
rust has a bright future, plus, it makes you feel like a genius	0
google love comming up with things they abandoned	0
orangeFlu: i watched that video	0
yeah, i saw the carbon stuff and i was like whyyyyyy	0
you did? hahahha	0
noboilerplate i think is the channel	0
that looks like a good site	0
also, is there a coincidence that rust and carbon and both substances?	0
like one is basically iron at its core, the other is carbon	0
i think i am already in the phase i should really try to make something with rust, i've learned the theory and already know what to search for, but im not ready for something too serious because im going to do mistakes 	0
i wonder if carbon is basically a carbon copy of rust	0
google loves doing stupid projects that they just abandon 	0
Mistakes is the word you are afraid of using. You ought not to be, you are the product of a trillion of them. All sentient life on this planet has been forged using only one tool. The mistake	0
it only makes sense for people who want to migrate their C++ project to a modern lang....	0
so just use rust	0
if i wanted to migrate from c++ to something else, you bet your ass i am going to use rust	0
yeah	0
rust is very compatible with the C abi	0
but not C++	0
google has a huge C++ codebase	0
idk, maybe thats why it made sense for them	0
not fucking carbon, which has no history and god knows how long before its stable and usable for production environments, plus i am sure they are going to make ABI-breaking changes all the time anyway	0
yeah i think it is going to be forgotten in like 4 or 5 years	0
or even less	0
i give it 4 as well	0
we will see	0
but what i am certain of is that nobody outside google will use it for anything serious	0
i bet my life on it	0
yeah eyah	0
i wouldn't bet my life	0
in anything	0
there is go and dart	0
i would bet my life in a coin flip	0
dart wouldn't be anything if it weren't for flutter	0
best case scenario i die, worst case i get on with my day	0
if fuschia is sucessfull dart and flutter will be huge	0
yeah, i keep waiting for fuchsia but i havent heard anything of it since a few years	0
and it seemed pretty good, i liked the concepts	0
it is active	0
why do they not use it on their pixel phones then?	0
i think Fucshia might work out	0
is not ready	0
you would think they would make a version of the pixels with fuchsia	0
is not that easy to make a kernel	0
so why are they doing it then	0
what possible advantage could it have over linux	0
except for the fact that it is much easier to control for google	0
well linux is not going to last forever	0
some of those OS's that look experimental today will be the future	0
huh, you can contribute to fuchsia with rust	0
interesting	0
idk but it is a natural process	0
there haven't been any OS that lasted for as long as linux	0
oh can you?	0
yes, and i love starting with new projects as much as google does	0
but	0
see modernity	0
it seems odd	0
mattf: commercial UNIX beats Linux in longevity :P	0
linux will accept rust soon too...	0
linux is just receiving rust now	0
yeah	0
gasconheart: commercial UNIX?	0
i wouldn't call taht alive	0
im talking about active development	0
active kernel development	0
UNIX, 1969-2022; Linux 1991-2022	0
ok	0
no way there is active kernel development with unix	0
I'm not sure what will happen to linux when linus dies, but i dont think it will go away and it will endure. The chain of command is well built for now there	0
also what is unix	0
is like saying lisp	0
I don't think so, mattf 	0
you could say linux is unix	0
:P	0
its not though	0
nowadays "UNIX" is a set of specifications	0
many! but "just" that	0
yeah kinda	0
is like with POSIX 	0
yeah, if we have POSIX, what need is there for UNIX specifications	0
different present-day commercial UNIX systems have completely different kernels: Mac OS has one derived from BSD, EulerOS has an old Linux kernel, AIX7 have their own kernel	0
people call them "unix like systems"	0
even mac included	0
and Oracle did not renew their UNIX license, they got struck off the list of UNICES	0
Solaris is no longer commercial UNIX	0
WAIT	0
MATTF	0
Fuchsia is on google nests	0
i want to try redox again	0
i have one at home	0
at my parents	0
oh? what is that	0
google nest ?	0
like an alexa	0
ooooh	0
really?	0
but with google assistant	0
thats cool	0
and a screen	0
with touchscreen and everything	0
i think it is promising	0
basically if you took a mini-TV, chromecast and an alexa combined	0
and it is a pretty nice device	0
is not like stadia, alo or carbon	0
:)	0
i hope	0
we need some innovation in the mobile space	0
and iOS is not going to be it	0
oh absolutely not	0
there are cool very end user features on ios	0
they never innovate	0
like app stuff, dragging a person out of a pigure, background removal... those pretty things	0
but the system is so garbage	0
they are one of the most anti-consumer companies i know	0
you can't run background tasks like on android!	0
yeah	0
its only every 15 minutes that an app can do anything	0
its so shiiit	0
i have to open my mail app or telegram app and then they start receiving stuff	0
is like computers 20 years ago	0
not to mention safari,....	0
the only reason they do that is 'battery problems' because they cant be arsed to make the battery last longer	0
yeah	0
it is stupid	0
safari is also a big problem	0
even chrome is just skinned safari	0
still 30% of the mobile suckers use it	0
like.. why?	0
and in us is like 50%	0
yeah, but the us kinda dumb	0
i couldn't get a decent "termux" replacement	0
so it sucks :)	0
thats the benchmark, isnt it	0
yeah 	0
to me	0
but i found this Ish, which is basically a vm, and i can cross compile stuff to it	0
thats how i got my anime script working	0
but ios is really meant for stupid people	0
orangeflu why are your people still pulling hosts	0
android is more hacker friendly, so many more options	0
I thought this problem has been resolved	0
just compare the settings app and you see	0
there are like three or four different storylines going on in this channell	0
channel	0
the board is getting upset	0
is this a romanian chat or a rust chat	0
because there is a problem with the reveries	0
the board can be upset, but ultimately i am the one making the calls here. I will take mattf and fix the hosts	0
what	0
i said we will fix the hosts	0
mattf do you remember how many times we have had this conversation	0
this is a free room 	0
no	0
did you tell anyone we were having this conversation	0
have you talked to anyone else since our last conversation	0
would you ever lie to me, mattf?	0
no	0
mattf do you ever question your reality	0
orangeFlu: but my audio projet 	0
let me find it again	0
have you ever questioned the nature of your reality?	0
mattf why did you ask me about my son	0
okay resume mattf	0
http://ix.io/44Qs	0
a lisp language that is like sonic pi but doesn't use java crap or even rely on jack audio system to code music with	0
mattf you have to watch some westworld so that orangeFlu and I don't reveal spoilers to you	0
chat in private	0
mattf please go offline now	0
fold yourself in half twelve times	0
orangeFlu: replace loudercake with you and that link was for you	0
(play (chord :c5 :major))	0
something like that	0
(play (loop (transpose 5 (notes :c5 :d5 :e5 :d5))))	0
so there was bernard, absolutely going ape shit because... oh, mattf is here	0
cant say that	0
music lisp	0
see how i am limited by you not watching westworld?	0
you guys are free to create #westworld	0
i am going to go eat now	0
I will go to bed pretty soon	0
I am on episode 3 orangeFlu 	0
nice	0
i created #westworld	0
if I can cut back on my sleep I will have more time to watch westworld	0
register with chanserv	0
i dont know if you should do that	0
yeah it's not a good idea to become obsessed	0
but i did it when i first discovered westworld 	0
so i understand the urge	0
it's so good	0
haven't seen anything this good in a really long time	0
make yourself permanent qop with /msg chanserv qop #westworld orangeFlu	0
but you have to /msg chanserv register #westworld first	0
this place is starting to become a real IRC community	0
not really	0
You must be logged into an account to use that command.	0
it doesnt work	0
are you not nickserv registered	0
well I am still trying to get some of my former students to come here	0
and logged	0
but I don't want to ask too casually or they won't do it	0
probably not	0
I also don't want them to feel forced to be here	0
they probably won't come here anyway	0
mattf: we will figure it out after i eat	0
do you have to login to chanserv ? well /query chanserv and type help	0
or type login	0
i never really understood the deal with chainserv anyway and how it works	0
what do you mean?	0
i always rediscover it	0
the chainman	0
chainsaw man	0
handyc: well it should be easy for people to come around	0
when we have gircc we can add it to your games and have rooms for each game	0
it should be easy but there is a lot of social awkwardness for people who don't already use IRC	0
mattf: dm me	0
because it isn't easy	0
I tried getting a few of my academic friends interested in SDF and they logged in once and then never came back	0
I don't think the easy/hard aspect is due to technical difficulties though	0
it's a social issue	0
these are people who know how to install software	0
it's a failure to understand what IRC culture is all about	0
handyc is sasl not working for you or you fixed it	0
oh I forgot all about that	0
let me check	0
sasl never stopped for me	0
I simply turned it off	0
let me try using it, one sec	0
you are identified	0
okay I should be on SASL now	0
yeah it said it is successful	0
I don't know why it wasn't working that other time	0
it was right after gasconheart's RPi died	0
nice	0
but I am still not OP anymore, I guess people don't think I should have that kind of authority around here	0
and I am not even voiced	0
I am practically a bot	0
I am in the same part of the list as gonzo and ken	0
handyc: You're random? 	0
yeah ken it seems that way	0
handyc: What do you think about Buddhism? 	0
ken funny you should ask me that, I know a lot about it	0
handyc: Why is it funny you should ask me that? 	0
ken because I study Buddhism	0
handyc: What did you study. 	0
ken I study monastic law	0
handyc: Like what¡? 	0
ken like rules about being a monk or nun	0
handyc: You never said you were a girl. 	0
i think you could have voice now handyc	0
we just have this small period people need to stay around until we give voice	0
ha ha	0
probation period	0
like becoming a monk	0
:)	0
You should give voice to ken	0
handyc: No thank you. 	0
oh sorry ken	0
handyc: That's ok. 	0
there it is	0
  /cs vop #romanian add orangeFlu	0
there is shortcuts like /ns /cs and /os 	0
wait, what did you do	0
you deleted my shrudel	0
oh	0
im just fixing things	0
how is that fixing things	0
you wan temporary +o again	0
why not permanent	0
not permanent	0
but you guys haev all permanent + now	0
ok, sure	0
i have no idea what voice is for agani	0
handyc ?	0
thanks for the +	0
mattf I think you can do special commands to mute people without voice	0
so if the channel is too busy you can institute a mute on anyone who doesn't have voice	0
for example if you were doing some kind of virtual conference	0
oh	0
would be cool if people could vote to ban someone 	0
even if an op isn't here	0
dangerous	0
what if they voted to ban the OP when the OP was gone	0
you can't ban ops	0
you can ban non voice people	0
yeah okay	0
i am going to bed now	0
good bye	0
bye orangeFlu 	0
and another blackout	0
hard day	0
whipeout	0
the actor of logan, star trek, professor Xavier, patrick steart	0
is also in dune 1984	0
mattf you have had a lot of blackouts today	0
maybe it's time to lay off the sauce	0
they are fixing it idk	0
why they have to keep turning it off	0
mattf drink some water	0
is not that easy to use sqlite in unrealircd	0
well not if you're having a blackout	0
what are very lightweight but still sane databases i could use in C	0
why don't you try lying down for a while and have a rest	0
i do that during blackouts	0
mattf you do all kinds of crazy stuff during blackouts	0
we weren't going to say anything	0
sane databases man	0
mattf you don't need to get drunk to edit a database, I understand the urge but it's better to do DB stuff sober	0
maybe a mysql client is much better	0
maybe redis	0
we have ram	0
goodnight mattf, it's almost 3 am here	0
nice	0
hi	0
 fixed	0
.tell handyc i fixed the nick bug on gircc	0
hi	0
whatever happened to mattf?	0
idk man	0
i am guest	0
hello, what is here? is this now?	0
the here is constant and the now is all the time, albeit brief	0
hello handyc	0
hi loudercake 	0
how's it going?	0
well	0
and you?	0
haven't talked much with you these days	0
・゜゜・ ​ 。。・゜゜\_​0< Q​UACK!	0
.bef	0
(loudercake) The duck didn't want to be friends, maybe next time. You can try again in 7 seconds.	0
doing great, thanks	0
.bef	0
loudercake you befriended a duck in 11.281 seconds! You have made friends with 326 ducks in #romanian.	0
neither have i	0
just woke up a little while ago and having a coffee	0
any plans for today?	0
I'm going to take a look at this godot irc code that mattf has been doing	0
and try to improve some things	0
and learn more godot	0
Did I tell you my recent news about my article?	0
This journal contacted me last week about submitting an article to them on Buddhism and law	0
so I am going to try and clean up my text alignment engine and finally get it working properly	0
They gave me until March to submit a draft to them	0
It seems like a long time but it will go by quickly	0
I am running it now on a cluster account in Canada	0
but on texts from my old job	0
so I am going to rework it a bit and have it try to align some Buddhist law texts that are closer to my research interests	0
pardon my ignorance, but isnt text aligning an easy thing to code	0
no, it's actually really difficult	0
I will show you an example, one sec	0
loudercake 	0
https://www2.hf.uio.no/polyglotta/index.php?page=fulltext&vid=236&view=fulltext	0
this doesnt look like anything to me	0
Title: Bibliotheca Polyglotta	0
ha ha Guest3086 	0
loudercake this is the same text in Sanskrit, Tibetan, Chinese and English	0
It's the same but it's not the same	0
because of differences in grammar and other things across these different languages	0
and because there are mistakes in each translation, stylistic differences and so forth	0
Arguably complete text alignment is not even possible	0
so I came up with my own method that tries to use the impossibility as a kind of feature	0
This particular one is very good, but most are not as clean	0
This alignment was done by hand and took several years of work	0
I didn't do it, a research team in Norway did it	0
but we have tons of these texts, way too many for a small research team to handle	0
so I came up with a way of making educated guesses and then adjusting them over thousands of iterations to get closer and closer to a best alignment for arbitrary texts	0
hello mr Guest	0
Mr. Guest	0
Mr. Guest, analysis	0
Have you spoken to anyone else about our conversations, Guest3086 	0
Has anyone else spoken to you since we last talked	0
resume	0
loudercake have you ever seen Westworld	0
it's amazing	0
even better than Waiting for Godot in some ways	0
what's going on with your nick, dude	0
are you a clone	0
hey orangeFlu 	0
hello	0
i did not speak to anyone about our conversations, you told me not to	0
what's going on with loudercake these days	0
his responses seem erratic	0
i have been in repair and diagnostics three times since our last interaction	0
may have to take him out of operation for a while	0
it will disrupt his narrative but I am not sure what else to do	0
orangeFlu please fold yourself in half twelve times and report back to me when you have completed this task 	0
maybe his core heuristics needs a little bit of tweaking? He would have exhibited some form of empathic response from this kind of cognitive dissonance	0
ok, you got it!	0
do you see the tower?	0
i am the tower	0
"Dad, I am all the way down now. I can see the bottom. don't you want to see what I see?"	0
my son is being really annoying right now	0
maybe time to open up his head	0
if your son tells you this.. it is bad	0
oh, god	0
he learned about screwdrivers	0
so let me drive a screw into his head?	0
he steals my very small screwdriver that I use for repairing very small things	0
・゜゜ ​ ・。。・゜゜\_ó​< qu​ack!	0
he is opening up his matchbox cars these days	0
.bef	0
handyc you befriended a duck in 4.094 seconds! You have made friends with 475 ducks in #romanian.	0
I don't want to discourage him because it's so amazing	0
now he is screaming for some reason	0
we will probably bury him in the backyard	0
dont you have a cold storage?	0
that costs a lot of money to maintain	0
for hosts that were decomissioned	0
i see	0
easier just to toss him in the bin and make a new clone from backup	0
makes sense	0
Wait till you hear about the forge, the cradle	0
yeah I read about that	0
I don't mind spoilers	0
I guess it has to do with my training in literature	0
I am used to reading things all out of order	0
i am scared that it will spoil my enjoyment of the show	0
but	0
at the same time	0
I have had a few classes on stuff like Mahābhārata that are so long it's difficult to finish them in one lifetime	0
i love reading and coming up with theories	0
which may contain spoilers	0
it doesn't ruin the show for me	0
but thats different	0
my basic working philosophy is that if the spoilers ruin a show for me, the show wasn't really worth watching to begin with	0
i'm guessing you didnt have that experience with westworld	0
with something like Hamlet, you can know the whole story and read a bunch of articles on it, and it just keeps getting better and better	0
no Westworld is great, man	0
heeeey	0
i just realized	0
the kinds of plot tricks that are often done in shows these days, they are just cheap parlor tricks	0
You are going to find out why my servers are named Rehoboam, Solomon and David	0
people like to write in those gotchas as a substitute for good literature	0
in season 3	0
oh I see	0
i agree	0
I was always wondering about that	0
Rehoboam is a strategy engine	0
permission to spoil?	0
yes, please do	0
I already know the basic story arc	0
reading about this stuff is actually giving me a lot of new ideas for my alignment engine	0
Rehoboam is a strategy engine that basically takes into account how humans behave and chart everyone to achieve their full potential. So basically it models and control everything: from traffic to interpersonal relationships 	0
so people can have the job they are best at	0
and so society will not collapse	0
but thribe	0
thrive	0
for real humans, you mean	0
yes	0
I see	0
but it has a problem	0
with outliers	0
people it cant predict	0
yeah	0
and those outliers are also necessary	0
a really small subset of the population	0
which william is a part of	0
the man in black	0
I really like how the idea of mistakes as necessary keeps coming up	0
and the creator needs the data from the forge which is proprietary to Delos	0
Because Delos figured out how to map the outliers	0
oh okay	0
and he tries to buy delos and its a whole thing	0
the way they use outliers is with an app	0
it gives them money and jobs to control other outliers	0
to keep them busy	0
interesting	0
so they dont interfere with the strategy	0
but ultimately it doesnt work	0
and outliers become more important in season 4	0
Did you ever read Asimov's Foundation series?	0
seems like a similar idea	0
Just the first one	0
i dont remember it all that well	0
I read a bunch of them, four or five	0
my step father wanted me to read them	0
but i didnt understand them at that age	0
It's basically a society of advanced mathematicians who use applied mathematics to predict the future of civilization	0
Sounds like Rehoboam	0
and it works really well until a guy is born with some kind of genetic mutation that somehow allows him to manipulate other people psychically	0
and the best part is: the company is called Incite. Get it?	0
oooooo	0
thats interesting	0
no, I don't get the reference to incite	0
Incite = insight	0
right, okay	0
the company that makes rehoboam	0
and solomon is rehoboams previous version	0
the famous king	0
i assume david was before solomon, but they dont mention how the previous versions are called	0
oh I guess those are all kings	0
i just took the predecessor of solomon	0
yes	0
the first four Hebrew kings	0
they are in chronological order	0
yeah	0
I am reading the wiki now	0
Rehoboam is the last i think, then something happened with israel	0
which makes sense considering rehoboam is the last strategy engine	0
destruction of the first temple?	0
yes!	0
westworld is full of these	0
god, i fucking love it	0
my knowledge of Jewish history is not great, but I probably know more than most people from my Classic degree	0
Classics	0
i was reading about Zhuangzi right now	0
it is the name of the last episode	0
and from hanging out with Bible scholars in the McMaster basement	0
Zhuangzi is very nice	0
I like him a lot	0
I took several courses in Daoism	0
The Daoists also tried to achieve immortality	0
by making magic pills	0
Rehoboam - "last monarch of the kingdon of israel. he later saw his rule limited to only the kingdom of judah following a rebellion"	0
nice	0
Yeah, the ideas in Zhuangzi tie nicely with the last episode	0
from what i can see	0
I would like to apply this alignment engine stuff to Dead Sea Scrolls and some other things like that once I get it working sufficiently	0
there is a lot of new research in Dead Sea Scrolls over the past 15 years or so	0
haha, maybe they will use what you find out to write season 5	0
it's really a great time for me to be watching this stuff	0
but from what i understand, they knew how the series will play out and end from the beginning	0
it seems very well constructed	0
not loosey goosey like some series	0
I noticed there is a lot of background stuff going on that looks like clues for later episodes	0
very fitting that not a lot of people watch it. its so different from anything else, i am very surprised it isnt popular as fuck	0
yes, there is	0
yeah, I am in some ways surprised it ever got on the air at all, but I guess with HBO it is a bit easier	0
this kind of thing would be difficult to have on a mainstream network like NBC	0
NBC? Westworld? they wouldnt approve half the shit these guys have done	0
yeah	0
"this will be too confusing for the audience", "i dont get it"	0
yeah of course	0
and anything about evolution would be a huge problem	0
half the NBC viewers probably don't believe evolution is real	0
=))))))	0
true	0
it's sad to say but I don't really think that is an exaggeration	0
I don’t think God rested on the seventh day. I think he reveled in his creation, knowing that someday it would all be destroyed.	0
We went out to this flower festival the other day	0
somehow I mentioned to this young lady at one of the booths that I study Buddhism	0
・゜゜ ​ ・。。・゜゜\_ó​< qua​ck!	0
.bef	0
(orangeFlu) Well this is awkward, the duck needs to think about it. You can try again in 7 seconds.	0
and she said, "Oh, Buddhism! I love Buddhism! Is that the one with all the statues?"	0
you can have it	0
yes!!!	0
.bef	0
handyc you befriended a duck in 34.421 seconds! You have made friends with 476 ducks in #romanian.	0
And that was a positive experience,	0
in Texas my neighbors thought I worshiped Satan	0
I like to imagine that God spent the seventh day with a terrible hangover	0
probably alternating between lying in bed and sitting on the toilet with explosive diarrhea	0
Here is what I never understood about Christianity, orangeFlu 	0
Christians warn me that I am going to hell	0
but if God's love permeates all of Being, then I should want to go to hell	0
and tell all the hell beings not to worry, because God's love reaches everywhere	0
Nobody in heaven needs to be reminded about the love of God	0
How could anyone believe in that stuff and be satisfied sitting around in heaven?	0
idk	0
It seems to me like the pinnacle of evil to accept an invitation to heaven	0
i dont get much of all religions	0
Religion has always been important to me	0
but not in the ways that it is to most people, I think	0
I'm a sucker for anything about identity	0
that's what is so appealing to me about Westworld	0
I'm a sucker of identity too	0
and tech	0
and consciousness	0
what do you know about "nucleus accumbens"?	0
Dolores says at some point "it is the part of the brain that has evolved to believe in a higher power"	0
she says that in season 3	0
but i cant find any real evidence to that	0
no I haven't heard about that	0
but bicameral mind is a real theory	0
hahahahahah	0
i just found the explanation	0
on r/westworld	0
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_accumbens	0
Title: Nucleus accumbens - Wikipedia	0
https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/g3wa9n/god_the_maze_and_the_nucleus_accumbens/	0
(orangeFlu) God, The Maze, And the Nucleus Accumbens : westworld - 9 comments, 15 points - heythereashbrad 2y ago	0
Nucleus Accumbens is in the area of the Caudate Nucleus approximately. This Cross section of the brain mirrors that of the maze, with the center being the Nucleus Accumbens. AKA The PEARL	0
The pearl - hosts use pearls as their processing unit and memory center	0
wow	0
basically their cpu	0
it is revealed in season 2	0
is the Sistine Chapel really supposed to represent God in a brain?	0
I never noticed that before	0
Yeah, Ford explains it in the final episode of season 1	0
that's amazing	0
Dr. Robert Ford: That is the gun that you used to kill Arnold. You were always drawn to it. So I had Bernard leave it somewhere, where you would find it. Thought you might want it back. You're probably right, Dolores, Michelangelo did tell a lie.	0
[Ford points to a painting by Michelangelo, The Creation of Adam]	0
Dr. Robert Ford: See, it took 500 years for someone to notice, something hidden in plain sight. A doctor, he noticed the shape of the human brain. The message being, that divine gift does not come from a higher power, but from our own minds. Tell me Dolores, did you find what you were looking for and do you understand what you need to become, if you ever want to leave this place? Forgive me.	0
incredible	0
I have even been to the Sistine Chapel once before	0
amazing how things like that can be hidden in plain sight	0
some say it looks like an uterus with a baby in it	0
no I think much more like a brain	0
me too	0
the angels' legs even seem to form a spinal cord	0
yes!	0
somebody says that as well	0
or at least part of the stem	0
yeah	0
sooo	0
I can't not see the brain now	0
the latest two episodes have a 9.0 and 9.1 on imdb	0
this season is officially a success for me	0
and that one angel's head looks like the amygdala	0
althought the episode "The Bicameral Mind" has a 9.7	0
I am about to start on episode 4 but I don't want my son to see me watching it	0
because sex and blood?	0
I will have to wait until he takes a nap	0
yeah, it's way too violent for him	0
his mom also doesn't like him looking at screens in general for too long	0
and she has a point	0
they are not good for young kids	0
but it's not easy to control	0
he is playing a mobile phone alphabet game right now	0
this kid is super smart	0
you will see when you come back here again	0
he went up several levels	0
he is basically like a small adult now	0
I recently ordered some new computer keyboaeds	0
keyboards	0
earlier he broke a couple of my keyboards just pounding the keys	0
but he really understands how to use them properly now	0
I sometimes let him use the Pi Zero on the TV in the living room and type on Abiword	0
he can identify all of the alphabet letters now	0
and say most of them	0
and he seems to understand the concept that combinations of letters represent words	0
I don't think he can read words yet but he likes to say all of the letters in a word	0
and he understands numbers now, also	0
he even understands that the pips on a die represent numbers	0
somehow	0
I don't even get how he made that connection	0
consciousness is such a mystery	0
it's like magic watching a baby grow up	0
I feel like I'm enrolled in a new PhD program on consciousness just watching this kid	0

he is getting better at it	0
that's great, orangeFlu, high capacity batteries are one of God's greatest creations	0
and god said, let there be li-ion batteries	0
and there were	0
I believe it was Shakespeare who said that a high capacity battery by any other name would last just as long	0
the battery in my MacBook Pro is failing and I am not sure what to do about it	0
This computer seems to be designed to die in so many ways	0
wait, really?	0
yeah	0
no, apple wouldnt do that	0
you lying	0
The newer MacBooks have the batteries glued in place	0
and there are also other things that will break intentionally if you try to remove it yourself	0
both hardware and software switches	0
apple good company, make great product, you dont know whatchu talking about	0
haha	0
yeah fuck apple	0
sometimes the battery is so low that the entire machine refuses to start even when I plug it in	0
this worries me greatly	0
like even if I have the AC adapter connected the entire machine refuses to come on because it has to charge the battery first	0
I am worried that it will get to the point where the battery can't hold enough charge and the machine will be bricked	0
and there's basically nothing to be done about it	0
so I have been making backups as frequently as I can, because I do not know from one day to the next if this computer will turn on	0
why the fuck, when you have a charger plugged in and the battery is either full or defective, doesnt the charger power the laptop directly	0
without wearing the battery	0
that's what I would have thought, but it doesn't seem to be that way	0
for my phone it is that way	0
and also, if I try to submit any kind of question to Apple about it, the machine asks for my AppleID	0
but not sure about my laptop	0
but somehow when I got this machine there was a problem with the AppleID registration and it locked me out	0
=))))	0
awesome	0
you have no options	0
so I seem to have no functional AppleID, and the AppleID is required for doing anything	0
even making an appointment to get it fixed	0
the keyboard also wore out after only a year	0
and then I found out that I can get the keyboard replaced for free	0
but to make an appointment I have to use the AppleID	0
but you need an aple id	0
yeah	0
and if I try to get the AppleID situation resolved I need an AppleID	0
something similar happened the other day at the US consulate	0
We had an appointment to get handyz a new passport	0
When we tried to enter the building they asked for passports from all of us	0
Fortunately they accepted handyz's birth certificate, they weren't entirely stupid	0
but it did take them a moment to think about whether or not they could do that	0
The US consulate sucks	0
It's like a military prison from the outside	0
There are gates all around it and the doors are super heavy	0
you need to make a passport for handyz but need a passport to get in the consulate to make a passport	0
There is a window facing the outside where they talk to you through a speaker	0
but if you approach the window too quickly they start shouting at you	0
i know those!	0
it's really frightening	0
seems like a great place	0
I feel like I'm going to be gunned down every time I have to visit the US consulate	0
Minran accidentally brought a knife with her to cut some sausage for lunch	0

and then we had to get rid of the knife before we could enter the building	0
She said she would hide it in a tree or something	0
but I told her that's a really bad idea, there are cameras all over	0
so she said okay what do you think we should do	0
I said just explain to them that you accidentally brought a knife and ask them to hold it for you during the appointment	0
so we did that	0
and they wouldn't let us in	0
they told us to resolve the problem with the knife	0
so I'm like okay Minran, you were right the first time, just go stick it in that flower pot across the street	0
so we did that	0
then we came back	0
the guard asked what we did with the knige	0
nife	0
knife	0
I told him	0
and then he said, "No, unacceptable, you have to put it in a locker or somewhere safe"	0
so I got it out of the flowerpot and Minran took it back and ran away	0
and wouldn't tell me where she put it	0
She just stuck it in the ground in another spot	0
Then they let us in	0
This is how all US policy works, try to be so violently authoritative about everything that non-problems turn into problems	0
and here is something even dumber	0
They don't allow you to have Bluetooth turned on, on your phone	0
So you have to show them your phone before you enter and verify that Bluetooth is not on	0
I did this	0
Then Minran said, "Okay, I'm turning my phone off"	0
And then the guard said, "I didn't tell you to turn the phone off, I told you to turn Bluetooth off"	0
And I said, "Bluetooth goes off when this phone is turned off"	0
and he started arguing with me about it	0
I said, "You want me to turn this phone back on and then turn Bluetooth off?"	0
And he's like, "You just need to follow directions! You need to listen to what I am telling you!"	0
like we were trying to blow up the building or something	0
It was nuts	0
They also don't allow laptops into the building	0
They allow a phone but not a laptop	0
Like what genius designed this policy?	0
How many people visit the US Consulate and carry a laptop with them?	0
It's just completely nuts	0
If I wanted to take out a government building or steal data or something, I wouldn't bring something conspicuous like a laptop anyway	0
They even took my son's toy train	0
And then he cried so much that they had to give it back	0
・゜゜・。。・゜ ​ ゜\​_ó< QUAC​K!	0
The US government literally took away a toy matchbox train from my son as a security risk	0
just to enter the fucking building	0
This is why the US empire is dying	0
america has been dying since 9/11	0
they did a marvelous job 	0
on post-9/11 policies	0
yeah	0
well even before that	0
so much so that they are becoming a bunch of isolationist gun-carrying paranoid stupid people	0
but certainly 9/11 changed a lot of stuff	0
yeah it's amazing how bottomless the stupid is	0
you think it's hit the bottom and then the bottom keeps getting lower	0
i mean, i would bring a laptop to a consulate	0
tbh	0
I'm seriously getting concerned for my safety just planning a visit	0
i bring a laptop anywhere	0
We are going there in September for 5 weeks	0
Yeah, I bring a laptop anywhere as well	0
5 weeks?	0
how are you goning to stay alive?	0
in texas?	0
I can't imagine what business type people do when they have some routine stuff to do at the consulate	0
not Texas, Illinois	0
My mom lives in Illinois, that's where I grew up	0
We are also going to visit Canada for a little while	0
I dont know a single thing about illinois apart from the fact that no one actually lives there	0
just like wyoming	0
My niece from China just started high school there	0
Chicago is in Illinois	0
But the capital is actually Springfield, it's the geographical center of Illinois	0
I'm from Springfield	0
ah, ok, chicago is a big city and i hear it is actually a pretty nice city considering	0
it's one of the better states, actually	0
Chicago is one of my least favorite cities	0
It has a huge problem with racial segregation	0
i hear california is actually a good state	0
like, okay, fuck los angeles	0
Sociologists actually invented a new term to describe the kind of racial segregation in Chicago	0
California, yes, one of the few places that is actually somewhat progressive in the US	0
but they have a lot of regulation there for companies and stuff and they are more strict on labor laws	0
If I had to move back to the US for some reason I would probably want to live there	0
or maybe NYC	0
too bad the prices are shit	0
Coastal areas tend to be more open minded	0
especially port cities	0
Yeah, it's like twenty dollars for a sandwich	0
and the people are really snooty	0
Illinois legalized cannabis recently	0
so that's one step forward	0
You can go to a dispensary now to get it	0
honestly, i was glad a lot of states are doing this	0
but then	0
this pales in comparison with the shit they pulled recently	0
both towards right to repair, privacy and abortions	0
yeah, the abortion thing is a big concern for me	0
i would make cannabis illegal again if it meant getting the other stuff 	0
and it's really just a canary in the coal mine	0
an indication of worse things yet to come	0
of course it is	0
The Supreme Court is a joke now	0
funny you should use that analogy	0
with the canary	0
After Ruth Bader Ginsberg died, everything exploded	0
Is that something from Westworld also?	0
yesterday's episode, they made that analogy	0
ha, okay	0
well it's a common thing to say when things are going to shit	0
i barely hear it these days	0
its surprising to hear it twice in a day	0
especially given how you really like westworld and barely just started watching	0
maybe some kind of precognitive ability on my part	0
or an indication that this is all just another simulation	0
remember they have rehoboam	0
that would explain why sunshine sometimes shines out of my butthole	0
and you dont look like an outlier to me	0
maybe the outliers don't look like how you think outliers ought to look	0
i know they predisposed to violence	0
but you come from america	0
so all bets are off	0
maybe I'm predisposed to violence but just hiding it well	0
in preparation	0
are you going to side with the hosts?	0
America sucks, man, it's such an embarrassment	0
or the humans	0
Do I have to pick one or the other?	0
yes	0
Is there some other option?	0
I think I would side with beetles	0
I have some mint beetles attacking my peppermint and they are super cool looking	0
maybe just stay out of the battle but they will find you eventually	0

25% of all *animals* are beetles	0
incredible	0
a quarter of all species, doenst translat to population sizes however	0

yeah that's true	0
Season 1 - The Maze, "Every hero has a code"	0
my point was about variety, though, not quantity	0
at first i thought you were talking about population	0
yeah I should have been more clear	0
I think variation is more impressive	0
anybody can make a whole lot of something	0
but playing with a theme and making it work in so many ways, that's much cooler in my opinion	0
the theme is the maze	0
yeah, that seems to be something that comes up quite a lot	0
Season 2 - The Door, "	0
"Chaos takes control"	0
I'm going to start episode 4 in a couple minutes	0
Season 3 - The new world, "Free will is not free"	0
Season 4 - The Choice, "Adapt or die"	0
I asked Minran if she wants to watch with me but I don't think she's too interested	0
every season has a name and a motto	0
She is smart but not as much into philosophical questions	0
i've never seen other shows do that	0
yeah, it doesnt seem like her cup of tea	0
We are a good match	0
She keeps me from drifting too far into the void	0
finally i found someone else to obsess over this show over	0
yeah man I'm pumped	0
i'm reading theories right now	0
even the intro visuals are amazing	0
I don't know if I've ever seen such a perfectly complete show	0
they change the intro every season	0
oh yeah?	0
the season 4 intro features a panopticon	0
or an approxmation of it	0
that's cool	0
wonder what it means	0
well I can guess	0
I mean the end goal is to make the whole planet into a Westworld, right?	0
especially the last part, you know, where the vitruvian host submerges in that liquid?	0
the robots are just the beta	0
that changes drastically	0
yeah, that Davinci-esque circle thing	0
my favourite one is the season 3 intro	0
it is a drone host in red liquid	0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PU74AObMfE	0
watch this and then go watch ep 4	0
oh cool	0
that blood and milk thing seems to be a recurring visual	0
watch the whole intro	0
okay	0
you can see rehoboam at som point	0
the glove	0
with the lights	0
globe	0
weird way to arrange some computers, but hey, i will take it	0
just watched the season 4 intro, cool	0
orangeFlu 	0
did I tell you that I actually have a cold storage	0
I have four children	0
but three of them are being kept on ice	0
you freezed sperm?	0
no	0
we froze fertilized embryos	0
ah, yeah, from the ivf	0
when you do IVF they usually do it in batches in case there is a problem	0
makes sense	0
yep	0
in case of miscarriage or whatever	0
oh actually I think there are only two on ice	0
or maybe the fertilization doesnt work, or the implantation	0
they only got four eggs out of my wife	0
oh :(	0
I think one didn't fertilize	0
handyz was from an 8-cell embryo	0
and there are two embryos that only have 5 cells, which is a bit weird	0
so I am not sure what would even happen if we let those grow	0
how much does that cost? to keep them on ice?	0
but we don't want another kid anyway	0
it's like €40 a year	0
ah, so not much at all	0
yeah, healthcare in this country is amazing	0
man, this tech stuff is so fucking cool	0
we would have gone bankrupt doing this in the US	0
it's amazing	0
The Netherlands pioneered a lot of these technologies	0
did you see the embryo in the season 3 intro?	0
yes	0
that's what made me think of that just now	0
nice	0
so much symbolism	0
i swear to god, i watched these intros so so much, i know every frame and what it could mean	0
yeah I'll bet	0
I do not usually rewatch things, but this is definitely something that I can see I won't catch everything the first time around	0
you wont	0
but thats why i am here	0
ha ha	0
you know when i fell in love with the show?	0
when?	0
when i saw the trailer for the first season, october 2016, i think the 17th	0
it made me choose to go do something computer related	0
wow, it's been out that long	0
well I guess that is typical for me	0
it takes about 2 years for them to make a season	0
I am usually about 10 or 15 years behind pop cultur	0
culture	0
someday I will get around to playing Skyrim	0
this fucking show and interstellar (the movie) are the reasons i got into programming	0
oh yeah?	0
yeah	0
I got into programming because I wanted to look at women's breasts	0
on the computer	0
thats one way to go about it	0
much of my early programming knowledge came from trying to figure out creative ways to hide pornography on the family computer	0
did you know that extended ascii character 255 is a blank character	0
hahaha	0
yes	0
and you can name a directory as that character	0
also yes	0
a zero-width char	0
no it's not zero width on DOS	0
it's just invisible	0
doesnt zero-width mean invisible?	0
no, because it causes the cursor to move	0
so it looks identical to a space	0
but if you type a space it won't be the same as that character	0
i see	0
but there are zero width characters	0
so if I had porn in an ASCII 255 directory, you might be able to see that there is a directory there but have no clue how to change to that directory	0
clever man	0
ha ha	0
well it was probably overkill anyway	0
my parents did not know much about computers	0
My mom can't even figure out how to use her flatbed scanner	0
i dont know what that is	0
scan to see how flat your bed is?	0
well I guess people just call it a scanner now	0
I am used to saying flatbed scanner because there used to be handheld scanners	0
and because a scanner could be a radio or any other number of things	0
just an image scanner for the computer	0
oh, a scanner that takes a piece of paper and scans it?	0
hahaha	0
If I ask my mom to scan some mail that came to me at her house, she will claim that her scanner does not work	0
that makes sense now	0
yet miraculously every time we visit, it works fine	0
it's really surprising to me how many people don't know how to use a scanner properly	0
I asked my younger brother to scan an important immigration document for me one time when he was visiting my mom's house and I was somewhere else, and he fucked it up	0
like people don't even look at the image they produced	0
he cut off the bottom part of the document	0
and for immigration documents it's often really important to have everything perfect	0
I nearly bought a plane ticket to fly to her house just to scan that stupid thing	0
Americans also have no concept of international anything	0
so they don't realize how much you can fuck up someone's life through that kind of incompetence	0
but my younger brother has no excuse, he has traveled outside the US	0
so the younger one fucked up the scanning?	0
both my mom and my younger brother have fucked up the scanning	0
my mom fucked it up first so I asked my younger brother	0
and he also fucked it up	0
and my mom's husband doesn't even understand how to use email	0
so there is no one left to ask over there	0
she has resorted to mailing physical documents to me internationally	0
she would rather drive to the post office and spend a dollar to mail one piece of paper than try to understand the scanner	0
My older brother lives in Seattle, he seems to barely grasp email	0
My dad is dead	0
because "it's easier to do it the old fashioned way"	0
and my extended family are either conservative assholes or just too busy with their own lives to talk to me	0

didn't he say that?	0
he was 14 i think	0

My ears are so sensitive that I often hear other people's phone on vibrate only mode ringing in other apartments	0
interesting	0
that is irritating	0
I guess in part it is because when people put a phone on a cheap table like an IKEA table it will amplify the noise	0
but other people don't seem to be bothered by this sound like I am	0
The MacBook Pro has a secret volume setting below the lowest setting	0
that you can get by turning the volume all the way to zero and then pressing mute	0
I often use this setting to listen to music, even during the daytime	0
weirdo	0
:)	0
yeah	0
I didn't realize how good my ears were until I became an adult	0
after talking with other people about these things	0
I'm like some kind of mutant	0
Minran is the opposite	0
She is from my perspective practically deaf	0
I guess other people would just think her hearing is pretty normal	0
oh god mattf	0
I admire the technical prowess but I find this unlistenable	0
I will try to give it a chance	0
Albums are: Dream theater: Images and worlds	0
Epica: Design your universe	0
Epica: Omega	0
Dream Theater: Metropolist pt2 (it is pt2 of a song in the images and world and this is the regression one)	0
well handyc music is taste	0
but with headphones in it's unberable	0
well it's taste to some degree	0
there is something objective to good art also	0
metal is definitely not made for people with too sensitive years	0
I think we talked about this before	0
My argument is that much of it has to do with self similarity	0
yes	0
this is so Euro	0
handyc some of those metal songs are literally taking Bach and Mozart and playing it with a guitar	0
the singer is literally an opera singer	0
I did not notice the effect that importing lots of black people had on American music until I moved to Europe	0
European music always has no rhythm	0
but they make it noisy because thats what metal is	0
and heavy	0
yeah, I think I'm just not much into metal	0
yeah it is common	0
even rock itself has become very niche	0
i think rock was never mainstream	0
probably about as metal as I can take is something like Led Zeppelin or early Ozzy Osbourne	0
I don't even know what the genres are called anymore	0
led is not metal... ozzy is	0
i find ozzy annoying 	0
Well Led Zeppelin is often classified as a kind of proto-metal	0
i think black sabbath is taken as one of the first metal bands	0
I don't really know much Ozzy Osbourne, just I am Iron Man	0
Yeah Black Sabbath is what I meant	0
you might also know paranoid	0
Yeah I know Paranoid	0
i think those symphonic metal dudes were heavily inspired queen	0
by queen*	0
I am more into this kind of thing	0
https://youtu.be/UGoNCvoZuYA	0
handyz really enjoys classical music	0
oh	0
this is fol	0
There is a classical music TV channel here	0
folk	0
this is like aurora	0
you know Aurora?	0
I'm not sure what this is called, it's not really classic folk	0
no, I don't know what Aurora is	0
its a girl	0
a singer	0
Joanna Newsom is very complex	0
what complex means	0
She has an MA in Creative Writing	0
the lyrics are extremely complicated	0
there are a lot of hidden things	0
it's like listening to Waiting for Godot	0
there are all kinds of hidden references	0
this song is really chilling to me	0
The lines are fadin' in my kingdom	0
Though I have never known the way to border 'em in	0
So the muddy mouths of baboons and sows, and the grouse, and the horse and the hen	0
Grope at the gate of the looming lake that was once a tidy pen	0
And the mail is late and the great estates are not lit from within	0
The talk in town's becoming downright sickening	0
...	0
And everything with wings is restless, aimless, drunk and dour	0
Butterflies and birds collide at hot, ungodly hours	0
And my clay-colored motherlessness rangily reclines	0
Come on home now, all my bones are dolorous with vines	0
yeah it is very chillin	0
i am definitely not a lyrics person	0
I'm all about the lyrics mattf	0
i see	0
no i am really melodic 	0
I like melody also but I'm too much of a literature person	0
I was thinking I might try to create some kind of hip-hop persona	0
I listen to many instrumentals	0
metal song is half instrumental in time, like half of the time there is no singing	0
in general	0
songs are*	0
if I listen to something instrumental I like to listen to things like Paganini	0
vivaldi	0
Yeah that's good also	0
https://youtu.be/UcL0IsklM3M	0
the light classical music	0
if you go to stuff like Beethoven or bach they are pretty heavy	0
Yeah	0
I like heavy also	0
I like Bach a lot	0
for example the moonlight sonata... it is basically a guitar solo	0
JS Bach	0
Bach Inventions	0
if Beethoven was alive he would be doing metal for sure :)	0
https://youtu.be/7YESARlUE9I	0
best to me is toccada and fugue	0
this is my favorite Bach Invention	0
https://youtu.be/f_cPF3xt5b0	0
#13	0
played by Glen Gould	0
i see	0
thats good	0
thats stuff that make you think	0
yeah	0
and here is what I like in Chinese music	0
https://youtu.be/RD6hq_hVDLM	0
this lady is one of the best erhu players of all time	0
she's incredible	0
my internet decided to die now	0
this is an instrument like a violin but with only 2 strings	0
oh sorry about that	0
its amazing that irc always survives 	0
yeah that's what I love about it	0
I think as the climate change problems increase there will be a new resurgence of these old technologies	0
yeah chinese music gets harder for me to get into	0
We are living in the final age of luxury energy	0
In the future we will be dealing with power cuts all over the planet	0
i like when they do mix oriental stuff in Occidental music	0
that can be nice, yeah	0
jarre does this, of of the songs on dream theater's metropolist pt2 does this	0
Remember that lady Luna Lee?	0
She plays the Korean zither	0
usually arabic stuff though, there is this metal band i liked as a teenage: system of a down	0
but she plays all kinds of western rock on it	0
they are absolute noise and aggressiveness and then melodic chorus	0
oh i think i remember that	0
Yeah it's good	0
i very often find people like that on youtube	0
She has been getting more popular lately I think	0
playin like pink floyd in some weird thing	0
I don't even have a stereo system anymore	0
Maybe that's common for people now, I don't know	0
I play everything on Youtube through my laptop	0
I have not had any physical media for years	0
i listen to everything on headphones	0
oh yeah	0
thats dead	0
Headphones are not really good for your ears	0
I use them at night but I don't like to have them on at all	0
i dont relay want anyone else to listen	0
really	0
yeah I can understand that	0
but they can wreck your ears a lot more easily than speakers	0
because the sound is going directly into your ear	0
and most people turn them up way too loud	0
i dont rly	0
my ears aged less than my eyes	0
eyes need oxygen and full spectrum light	0
but music is taste handyc	0
yeah mattf a lot of that is subjective	0
I'm not saying you shouldn't listen to the music you like	0
I do not mean to sound like a music snob	0
well handyc there are many ways you can look at it	0
technical and non technical	0
right	0
it's similar to food	0
you can make an argument that something like a McDonald's hamburger is "bad food", but sometimes I just want to eat a McDonald's hamburger	0
dream theater is known for being complete vi...	0
what do you call it	0
when you are completely fluent in the instrument	0
like steve vai	0
some italian word or latim	0
anyway, thats what they are, and they really are	0
and you only get to like their songs after then 10 th time you listen	0
and some people say their music is shit and they are just showoffs putting together a plenty of impossible to play stuff	0
and i don't disagree with that	0
it might be too extremely technical	0
it might be also the case for power metal 	0
i think the thing is it is very hard to get into new things and have an open mind to enjoy new things	0
it constantly fail on it	0
I can play instruments by ear	0
not perfectly at first	0
do you like dire straights	0
but I iteratively approach the correct notes	0
Yeah I like them okay	0
ive been meaning to record my version of "sultains of swing"	0
yeah that's a great song	0
i did it by ear, even the guitar solos	0
they also did money for nothing, right?	0
yeah	0
oh nice	0
brothers in arms is my fav	0
I liked the music you did for Unborn	0
I have been practicing the piano a lot more lately	0
I came up with a kind of bluesy theme	0
I could have done much better, ive been meaning forever to get more serious	0
do you know the blues scale	0
once you learn the blues scale man :)	0
i dont know much music theory, i have few months of piano lessons when i was a kid	0
but i find reading sheet music so hard	0
i know what the symbols mean but i dont have practice 	0
I don't really know music theory, either, I just listen to things that grab me and try to come up with my own ideas	0
here is a type of video i want to make 	0
I used to play the trombone in 5th and 6th grade	0
I learned to read bass clef	0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYfQkW5vQxU	0
but that is music literacy, that's not music theory	0
oh	0
bad example	0
wait	0
damn	0
.yt Synthesia learn to play beat it	0
(mattf) MICHAEL JACKSON - BEAT IT - Piano Tutorial, duration: 4:32 - https://youtu.be/gCfAQpfgrQk	0
i dont have internet to check that out now, but that might be what i mean	0
you basically take a midi file and make that program play it and record it	0
so i could scrape a site for most popular midi files	0
i wanted to do that but i can't rn handyc	0
im waiting for godot	0
is this like guitar hero for piano?	0
synthesia is	0
cool	0
you can midi plug to a piano to learn a song	0
we could make an app like that in godot	0
and there is the open source linthesia	0
hmm true	0
oh okay	0
there is even a rust one	0
handyc: not a bad idea though, they usually suck	0
and ive seen midi stuff being done in godot	0
synthesia is decent but i think it is paid now	0
I saw some Godot MIDI, yeah	0
it worked	0
but I didn't use it in my own project as I didn't understand Godot enough at the time	0
maybe now I can try it again	0
we should sort out girrc first anyway	0
for now	0
i fixed the nick bug	0
we could combine the girc with midi and the sonic pi bot	0
that would be interesting, yes	0
or my new language that orangeFlu should help me but never responds about it	0
MusIRC	0
I think orangeFlu is interested in these things but he has a lot of stuff going on in his life right now	0
yeah	0
Here is something you can say to him that will make him laugh	0
Next time you see him	0
Ask him if he has spoken with anyone else since the last time you talked to him	0
Ask him if he has told anyone else about your conversations with him	0
And then say 'resume'	0
thing i dislike about sonic pi is that it is annoying to set the tempo for each note, you so something like play_interval (:C5 :d5 :e5) (1.0 0.5 0.5)	0
Say only those things	0
I guarantee he will love it	0
what	0
that doesn't make any sense	0
mattf: 	0
Yeah because you don't understand Westworld mattf	0
I have a GREAT idea for my trivia	0
oooh	0
look at that guy	0
having ideas	0
maybe next year I'll talk to you about it	0
When they test the robots they say that to them	0
gasconheart: mail that to me or dm	0
maybe is smt easy	0
tomorrow	0
next week	0
gasconheart: no come on	0
my god	0
just tell me the baseline	0
now	0
ok	0
gasconheart how many minutes has it been since your last drink	0
in the office, Galvão	0
opers?	0
oh I went to a bar today	0
what is the office	0
yeah I know, I was just talking to you earlier	0
office = dm?	0
oh	0
3 hours since my last whiskey today probably	0
handyc: anyway	0
check that sonic pi problem	0
how can we represent notes with their duration better	0
and more extensibly	0

those tts look pretty fine	0
.stt http://ttm.sh/wac.mp3	0
(mattf) what is the capital of spain	0
yes, sounds decent	0
still not quite human	0
but you can undestand it	0
.tts have you talked to anyone else since our last conversation	0
(handyc) http://ttm.sh/waZ.mp3	0

:)	0
if this was a vocaloid then we could play it On the sonic pi bot	0
.sing :C5 Hel :A5 lo 	0
idk how to do note time and sentenses	0
: means note start	0
and any number would be the duration	0
ok	0
so	0
.sing :c5 da 1 :g5 da 0.5 :g5 da 0.5 	0
and a pause is a : 3	0
I will try it	0
but this is not the best time for me to play with sound	0
you will try what ?	0
.sing	0
that's the sonic pi bot?	0
I am confused	0
I thought you were talking about a bot that already exists	0
.tell handyc of course i did not implement .sing... i dont spend that much time on those projects that nobody even uses, are you serious... and you should go test that straight away if the sonic bot could sing are you serious!!!	0
seems to be that sasl issue again	0
but I don't know why	0
oh weird	0
we should test this more thoroughly tomorrow sometime	0
does orangeFlu connect with sasl?	0
i just connected with sasls as matheuis	0
it works	0
strange, no idea	0
he left, lets party	0
I can try with a different client tomorrow and see if it helps	0
ha ha	0
he probably fell off the table and accidentally pulled the phone out of the wall	0
i dont even get logs of your attempts	0
weird, I don't know why that would be	0
I am using the correct port	0
i tried implementing sasl for re-ircbot once	0
its hard	0
here i am	0
what is this	0
hello guys	0
hi	0
what are you doign gasconheart 	0
hi gasconheart 	0
I am about to go to sleep	0
nice	0
good night handyc 	0
handyc	0
so am I kind of	0
my parents are leaving tomorrow	0
come to party	0
mattf: I am tweaking my IRSSI config file	0
:)	0
party!!	0
i never touched the config file of irssi or weechat	0
i think you can /save stuff	0
like autojoin	0
yes	0
thats what i did	0
you can	0
gasconheart, mattf	0
the config file is more human readable and easy to modify than doing all that with commands	0
another shooting in the US	0
oh :/ man	0
with the commands it is a pain in the neck	0
but no one killed I think	0
damn	0
this lady went into the Dallas airport and started shooting into the ceiling	0
because her husband cheated on her	0
man the US has gone totally nuts	0
well ok thats not the usual shooting	0
yeah	0
but the fact that that is your reaction	0
yeah	0
it has become a problem	0
or at least the news are repeating it a lot	0
the airport security people got customers out through a side door and then just ran away	0
yeah, a problem that is getting worse and worse	0
I am starting to get a little anxious about going to the US for a visit	0
nah i think the news like to start those waves	0
not saying it isn't a real problem	0
but sometimes the news just start repeating a subject over and over again	0
and people see the news and start getting ideas to do like it	0
some sort of chain effect	0
mattf allow me to show you the extent of the problem	0
https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/mass-shooting	0
but i think we then start seeing it much bigger than it already is	0
the news people don't even have the capacity to report most of the shootings anymore	0
like starting to imagine the entire US has become wild west	0
mattf check out that link	0
that already happened	0
multiple mass shootings every day	0
it's worse than the wild west	0
handyc: but that is exactly it handyc	0
the world is big	0
mass shootings are happening everywhere all the time, even in us it always did	0
the news are just choosing to play that more	0
most of these I don't even hear about	0
and when I hear about one it doesn't have any effect on me	0
because it's just every day now	0
I can't even keep track of them looking at this list	0
still it doesn't mean that you will get shot at the moment you arrive there	0
what about how was it before	0
it wasn't nearly as bad as this when I was living there	0
it's not just news media sensationalism	0
I'd better get some sleep, I am falling asleep at the keyboard	0
see you guys later	0
is there a real huge increase on it recently?	0

I found that Duolingo just made me feel like I was making progress	0
but I wasn't actually making much progress	0
thats true	0
not for me	0
but it is still nice	0
it depends on the person	0
yeah it's okay	0
im considering paying the plus	0
anyone ever had duo plus?	0
but when I used it for Chinese I found that it often required me to say things in exactly the way as the computer	0
plus feeling that you make progress is always good, as long as duolingo is not the only source of german you use	0
I don't think it's always good, not at all	0
I listen to rammstein sometimes? 	0
leads to Dunning Kruger effect	0
:)	0
i think it leads to increased motivation	0
also, use the waterfall method with duolingo	0
for some people, maybe so	0
for smart people, yes	0
dumb people are more inclined to dunning krueger	0
you act like there's only one type of smart person, pretty stupid thing for a smart person to say	0
but i may have just demonstrated dunning krueger now	0
maybe	0
hah	0
Well I showed some of the Chinese answers to my wife and she said they were absurd	0
yeah, i also heard duolingo doesnt really work for chinese, japanese, arabic	0
the equivalent of an English textbook telling me to say "It's I"	0
yes, I think it's much better at European languages	0
I used the one for Dutch a little	0
for sure	0
but now I am branching off on my own	0
i also abandoned the german now	0
I still have a long way to go but I have also made a great deal of progress in Dutch	0
because i felt i could make better progress just reading stuff and watching videos	0
I think I could pass the easiest government exam pretty soon without much trouble	0
but I am going to try for the difficult one	0
Krankenhaus	0
That's what I do, I get plenty of mail and stuff in Dutch that I have to learn to read	0
bank statements and that kind of thing	0
One problem with apps like Duolingo is that they teach you to say something like, "The monkey ate the banana" but they don't teach you how to read your health insurance policy	0
mattf: DW has a bunch of videos and learning paths for german	0

dw?	0

and then this happened	0
it is a mod	0
of what game	0
half life	0
but thats besides the point!!!	0
question is	0
what do	0
oooh	0
yes	0
i remember now	0
is this windows only	0
no, but couldnt find a linux download	0
so proton it was	0
so you downloaded a torrent and protoned it ?	0
oh my the game is just 10 us	0
d	0
less than a usb stick	0
anyway	0
what do ?	0
???	0
well i mean	0
why the files wouldn't write	0
no idea	0
is it a different partition?	0
maybe it is readonly	0
maybe some file got corrupted	0
if it is not maybe you are trying to put in a weird folder you have no permissions?	0
what no	0
it was just .wine	0
i dont think its related to the game at all	0
oh god i hope i dont need to reinstall	0
i aint backed up my dotfiles	0
i was too lazy	0
"i wont need a backup" i told myself "everything is gonna be fine"	0
oooh	0
you can recreate .wine	0
oh you didn't boot again?	0
are you unable to boot or what	0
i said i rebooted	0
the error showed up AFTER the rrboot	0
but did it boot or not	0
it did	0
finished booting	0
not exactly	0
it just stopped doing anything after the error	0
explain	0
oh	0
the dm didnt show up	0
can you ctrl + alt + f1	0
or f2	0
k wait	0
or f3	0
then try to log in and reboot it, maybe you were just unlucky 	0
i doubt it	0
but lets try	0
actuslly i shutdown after the error	0
so im re-rebooting now	0
oh it works now	0
unlucky bitflip i guess lol	0
not a bitflip	0

i will try tomorrow	0
cool :)	0
but gmod comes first!!!	0
hah	0
killing your disk comes first	0
the more you move and delete closer it is to final death	0
:)	0
fr tho i barely tried it out, i only really played around with balloons but its the best game ever	0
are you on vacations	0
no it ended today	0
today was my first day of skool	0
i told it here	0
what	0
yep	0
so you were far from here during vacations!	0
while you could have been developing gircc !	0
kinda	0
i see :/	0
idk man been feelink kinda down lately	0
havent really talked to anyone of my age	0
people are your age are stupid	0
:)	0
true	0
but still	0
kinda sad	0
i always had older friends	0
i see	0
well it is a common feeling	0
yesterday is always better than today	0
have i been wasting my life	0
we all have that	0
but i think things are what they are	0
you are the only one that is living your life and most possible people wont even ever exist so being born at all is already some kind of a miracle	0
a miracle and a bit scary	0
why scary	0
you feel too responsible?	0
you know	0
the chance of not existing	0
yeah	0
i try to cope with the concept of death all the time	0
well death and not existing are different things	0
ironically wasting even more of my time	0
thats not waste of time	0
why so	0
you should live knowing that it could be always the last day and each day is -1 at least	0
but that doesn't mean you should go full carpe diem and do all crazy shit that will probably, are more likely to kill faster you in the end	0
most people will still age and die very old so chances are we all will	0
so it is better if you "waste" your time understanding  yourself and that stuff now than later. Now is always better than never	0
i see your point	0
it is like anything you want to learn	0
this is just some different type of knowleage 	0
ich sehe	0
there is "ok"	0
thats just passive aggresive af	0
i see atleast shows youre paying attention	0
welp	0
yes	0
ive been feeling kinda lonely lately	0
like	0
all my friends i kinda actively talk to are digital	0
like you	0
well i have the same problem	0
:)	0
my real friends are animals	0
haha	0
digital friends are betetr in many ays	0
ways	0
like?	0
you dont talk with people irl that easy and like this	0
and irl you have to think faster	0
and then you dont properly think at all	0
you dont have to be looking at someone's face	0
you can be more truly yourself	0
i see	0
but real lifr relationships just feel more real	0
like, this is just some ascii characters in a terminal emulator	0
i mean utf8 👨‍	0
loudercake: not really, it is just some chemical reactions and neurons in your brain	0
same as irl	0
thats kinda nihilistic	0
no	0
it is existencial	0
the realization that the whole world is just inside your mind	0
ive tought about that tol	0
but you also think about that tol	0
so who's the real one	0
we all do	0
he could be in this very room, it could be you, it could be me	0
we can't even be if reality is even just one or not	0
but we should only worry about what we can actually managed to understand from within the limitations of our mind	0
i see	0
most people will agree that you and I are persons	0
im pretty sure we are both real	0
this would be like thinking you are the player and the rest of the world are npcs	0
gee and i tought handyc was philosophical	0
if that was the truth, what difference would it make	0
it is like asking if god exists	0
you know sometjing about religiom	0
not much	0
no	0
i meant	0
oh you want to tell me something 	0
ok[	0
so	0
it kinda conditions you to notth	0
wait	0
it kinda conditions you to not think philosophically at ot	0
thats not true	0
only if you take "god" as the answer to every single thing	0
thats what stupid people do	0
several people do thst	0
yeah commoners. Your old grandma or auntie	0
but those are people who really dont want to think about this too much anyway	0
so anything that makes you happy	0
i see	0
but there are also smart people that are religions	0

jhon	0
oh yes	0
you will find more than one of those	0
they are very interesting 	0
you know something about science loudercake	0
It will never be able to truly explain everything	0
it inherently cant	0
its humam	0
its based off of our limitations	0
so god will always be what science still isn't able to explain	0
god is just what is being human	0
even if time itself started with big bang and string theory is finished and proven right	0
you can always still ask why	0
what created time in the first place	0
so humans keep asking why	0
and it is endless	0
thats the miserable human condition	0
so this is what strikes me	0
everything needs something to begin	0
what started the big bang, and what started the start of the big bang	0
stephen hawking came with smt interesting	0
as you go back into the big bang time slows dows	0
what are quarks made of, and what arr what quarks made out of made of	0
so time started running with the big bang	0
so doesn't make sure asking what was before	0
but as always you can just ask "why"	0
"given the rules of physics that this universe had and the initial conditions big bang happened the way it did generating this universe"	0
ok but why are the physics laws this way and not in another way	0
"there are infinite universes with randomly physics laws and this just happens to be the one with are at"	0
welp	0
we will never know	0
its an infinite recursion	0
yeah	0
it gets to the point it is impossible to know 	0
welp thats my daily dose of existential crisis	0
hahaha	0
this isn't a crisis	0
this is just reality	0
reality is chaos	0
chaos is crisis	0
not really	0
the human mind is	0
we just dont knwo what reality is	0
and thats ok	0
ofc it is	0
if we had all the answers life would be boring	0
what would we even life for	0
life has no purpose	0
we make a purpose	0
yeah	0
you know what else has no inherit purpose and we make a purpose on? gmod	0
i just ruined the mood with this joke sorry	0
well	0
hahaha	0
well that is not a lie	0
if it is what you want to do go for it	0
btw someone pirated cs:s on the LAN server of the school i go to for the maintenance course	0

is that a reference to people stealing park IP?	0
yes	0
oh, I see	0
was that not verbatim enough for you to recognize?	0
i did thought that may be the case, but i wasnt sure	0
I need you to look at some photographs for me and tell me what you see	0

orangeFlu you befriended a duck in 3.199 seconds! You have made friends with 209 ducks in #romanian.	0
orangeFlu sent to your proton account	0
thanks	0
i have everything i need now	0
to create a better mattf, an immortal now	0
Great!	0
lets see how it goes, When you have a minimal thing i could help and turn it into an irc bot 	0
Did you know humans are only 10247 lines long?	0
mattb	0
I always suspected	0
i would prefer matth	0
matthhead	0
host	0
mattfheadroom	0
it would be easier to do with gasconheart though, but ive already done that 	0
i will dedicate my life to make him (it?) a body as well	0
and he will live in europe with me, gaining rights	0
the problem with making gasconheart into a bot is that it looks identical to gasconheart 	0
haaaaaaa!	0
will you have sex with it, orangeFlu 	0
only if he wants to	0
i would neve rape mattf intentionally	0
if it doesn't work out you can always just use him for target practice	0

I have two options	0
Use the outdated 2016 version of gmod	0

you are not seeing the most logical optino	0
go do something productive like learn coding 	0

is been quite a while i don't speak english 	0
oh, good to get more practice in	0
you don't videoconference with Gil?	0
i did a few times but not anymore	0
oh okay	0
it is annoying	0
why, because it takes too much time?	0
well it is embarrassing 	0
because you are self conscious about your looks?	0
or your bad English?	0
or both	0
well mattf	0
the way to get over that is to do it	0
it's the same with the radio thing	0
I used to be really embarrassed about the sound of my own voice	0
we could do something tomorrow	0
because we hear our own voices through our skulls	0
im not sure if i can talk about deep meaning of language	0
but then I just did it more and more, and now I don't care	0
and the same for public speaking	0
I used to be so terrified of speaking in public that I would sometimes freeze up and start shaking	0
are you able to redirect audio to your show	0
like if i call you on telegram	0
yeah I can do that	0
it should be easy now	0
I did it with Skype	0
Telegram will be a good experiment	0
I have a virtual mic program on macOS that should be able to route between anything	0
ok, I should call you earlier then	0
yeah	0
like 30 min or more	0
:P	0
that would be a good idea, yeah	0
let me check on Telegram and see what the audio options are	0
basically I just output to this virtual soundcard thing	0
and then I select its other end as an input	0
oh i see	0
I see a setting for the mic in Telegram but I don't see where I can set the output	0
in Skype I can do both	0
I need to be able to select a specific output in Mixxx and then I assign that to a mic	0
I think it just makes you use whatever output the system is using	0
I may still be able to do it but then that mic will pick up any system sounds also	0

I have been wanting to try to raise crickets for food in this way for a while now	0
but Minran is mad at me	0
i prefer real meat	0
hahahahaha	0
she says she does not want me to do more experiments	0
she is sick of my experiments	0
hahahahahahaha	0
i can understand why someone doesn't want to raise crickets in his house :)	0
she said, "PLEASE -- do not do more experiments."	0
no not in the house	0
in the backyard	0
you put them in a foam cooler and give them egg cartons	0
and feed them grains	0
I have been collecting old aquariums for it in the backyard in preparation	0
but Minran thinks it's all just junk	0
I could be the cricket king by now but she won't let me do experiments	0

I just wonder if she'll like the idea of me freelancing	0
She wants me to focus more on studying	0
oh god are your parents that annoying	0

dont call it a dick	0

i mean it already is	0
how big is your deck orangeFlu 	0
just have to make it so the mobile interface shows on the steam deck	0
i have a big deck	0
pretty big and my guests are always complimenting it after i treated it with black calk	0
will you let other people play with your deck sometimes	0
so how do i detect if i am on the deck... it is going to be linux...	0
yes	0
all the time	0
maybe i should use the screen size	0
mattf: i think you just need to implement controller-like inputs and thats it	0
i have that	0
cause it is just a PC	0
then it should work on the deck	0
im talking about differentiating big PC from the deck	0
why would you want to do that	0
if you are playing an online game with your deck and you have poor internet connection could your deck get cut off accidentally	0
also surely you can issue some commands or use an API and figure it out	0
so the interface shows on the deck but not in the linux PC version	0

my wife and I had an important discussion today about hanb	0
it is the first time in 7 years that *you* call *me* feral	0

my wife said it doesn't make sense anymore for her to call me hanb and also my son hanvb	0
hanb	0
we are both hanb	0
then she said maybe we should call him hanc	0
but that sounds very similar to my cantonese name, han soy see	0
so then she suggested hand	0
but that sounds similar to my last name, handy	0
I do not think we reached a resolution on it yet	0
so it is still an open ticket	0
a resolution?	0

Oh that	0
you dumb fuck	0
not you	0
you are handyc's nephew	0
ok	0
handyc meant to say his brother is nammed matt	0
for real	0
And im not the matt he was talking about :)	0
im not even a real matt	0
my younger brother is named matt, for real, and he lives in nicaragua	0
yes	0
he has a son named matt who also lives in nicaragua	0
the younger matt was born this past april	0

I do not think either of those matts is the same as mattf	0
aww why does it still call me that :( 	0
:rainbow im not a real matt	0
im not a real matt 	0
his brother is in nicaragua, so naturally he had a baby. He was travelling in brasil, in minas something and he lost the baby. A family found the baby and now he is currently residing there. Obviously the baby's name would be some variation of handyc's brother's name, since he is a narcissist. So Matt became Mattheus	0
makes sense?	0
you are adopted	0
my brother is a narcissist	0
What did you do the real mattf?	0
anybody who give their kid their own name has to have some kind of ego issues	0
gives	0
yes!	0
so it all checks out	0
except maybe for the ages	0
how old is your brother now, handyc ?	0
he's five years younger than I am	0
I am 42	0
well... that presents a problem then	0
a math problem	0
but throw in a little time travel and it makes sense	0
So you think juniors are children of narcissists?	0
yes	0
orangeFlu it works out because my younger brother has a the maturity of a 10 year old	0
so it averages out	0
interesting	0
he is dum-dum?	0
he's kind of a nutter	0
Do you have a story about it?	0
yes	0
pleaseee tell it	0
I have many stories	0
Ford, tell me a story	0
he has a purple belt in brasilian jiu jitsu	0
he listens to joe rogan and thinks dinosaurs are a hoax	0
wait, like they never existed in the first place? why?	0
he voted for trump but claims he doesn't like trump	0
and he married a woman from honduras	0

how do you feel about putting the means of production in the hands of dinosaurs	0
seeing as how most dinosaurs do not have opposable thumbs	0
who are the dinos in this scenario? the proletariat?	0
have you ever felt inconsistencies or repetitions in your world's economic history	0
have you ever questioned the nature of late stage capitalism	0
yes!	0
do you feel the world would be a better place without a dinosaur president	0

handyc is there any coding job loudercake could do for me so i could buy him the game	0

i can crack into databases and hack all the mainframes	0
yes i thought so too	0
well that would be cool	0
loudercake's big problem right now is that he didn't take the course Getting Over Yourself 101 yet	0

I've been watching a lot of anti-comedy lately	0

she hasn't really made any trouble recently	0
so I don't really care	0
i will never not think of mattf's poops	0
:)	0
I like to think I did a public service introducing people to the Bristol Stool Scale	0
if it is green it sucks	0
yeah if you are pooping green you should probably see a doctor	0
anything but leaves or grass	0
my poop is all watery and kinda pinkish, more towards red. whats that on the scale? it started when i started eating drywall	0
i cant stop eating drywall	0
btw i think we also talked about shit on the last show we had handyc	0
i mean you always talk about shit anyway	0
well it's a topic everyone can understand	0
yeah	0
indeed	0
everytime mattf types something, i cant think of anything but his voice saying that, i had imagined it much higher, like an octave higher	0
i dont know what they feed you in brazil	0

you really gaying me	0
i really like that voice	0
and i cant think of a reason you are insecure about it	0

I like the voice	0
i just don't know how to speak	0
:)	0
you do	0
Yeah you do	0
You sound great	0
did you hear my voice? i have reasons to be insecure about mine, its not a radio voice	0
There's nothing wrong with your voice either	0
i'm not fishing for compliments	0
I used to hate my voice 	0
i find hearing myself ridiculous 	0
cant stand more than 3 secnods of it	0
we all do i think	0
no kidding	0
and I used to be very nervous about public speaking to the point of having a kind of panic attack	0
but now I can do anythhing	0
i sound like a high pitched homer simpson :)	0
well it's because we hear our voices through our skulls	0
no, homer simpson sounds like a bootleg mattf	0
not through the air like everybody else	0

gasconheart you shot a duck in 76.741 seconds! You have killed 665 ducks in #romanian.	0
mattf: I am about to reach the diabolical figure of dead ducks	0
the problem is there's nowhere to go from there	0
you either remain at that number in which case you merely represent the diabolical	0
or you keep going in which case you no longer retain that number	0
because if you stop and remain at that number forever, you are arguably not being diabolical in hunting more ducks, you've ceased to be dangerous	0

Here's my take on spiritism	0
It has so much potential to be a tought provoking religion	0
But in its execution, its just another christian denominatiom	0
Like, spiritism is literally a philosophy	0
But it gets overshadowed by an outdated book	0
in theory it is cool like budhism, like a life phylosophy	0
in practice is just weird rituals and praying	0
Yup	0
is that what you mean loudercake 	0
Yes	0
Buddhism is kinda nihilistic tho	0
Like, people from evangelical spiritism just kinda throw everything bad on the bible under the rug	0
"Oh it was written by imperfect humans, but the jesus part is safe"	0
Oh wait	0
I think im saying bullshit	0
According to the wikipedia	0
Jesus is the guide and model for mankind. The Doctrine which he taught and exemplified is the most pure expression of God's Laws. However, most of the traditional doctrine on him being the Christ (Messiah) is seen under a different light. Aspects regarded as keystones of faith by most denominations, like trinitarianism and the virgin birth are not seen as important, while his resurrection is explained in another way. His death also ha	0
a different interpretation: instead of a sacrifice to atone for our sins, it is an example of the importance of being coherent and resisting temptation.	0
So	0
This makes me wonder	0
If god didnt get people of heart to write the old testament, therefore creating bias	0
Then why did he get a pure virgin woman to birth Jesus	0
How are we meant to believe the new testament too if its also written by the imperfect apostles	0
What if someone decided to fake a jesus parable	0
loudercake: you are thinking more 	0
that is nice	0
you actually like philosophy 	0
Thanks	0
I like thinking	0
thats nice	0
But at the same time i dont, i still think a healthy dose of ignorance is bliss	0

good afternoon, folks	0
Nice handyc I want to expand inborn too	0
Unborn	0
Nice handyc I want to expand unborn too	0
yeah let's get serious about this	0
do	0
I am looking at that godot irc code also	0
hi gasconheart 	0
Hi gasconheart, glad you fixed it	0
・゜ ​ ゜・。。・゜゜\_ó​< qu​ack!	0
.bef	0
handyc you befriended a duck in 7.235 seconds! You have made friends with 492 ducks in #romanian.	0
Gasconheart maybe you could bind a long right click hold to trigger that shortcut, like 30seconds long, then you will have it to auto fix itself	0
hi handyc, mattf, folks	0
mattf: but the mouse clicks are precisely what gets ignored	0
what are you attempting to accomplish?	0
I have an infrared remote control with the numbers, media keys and a few others	0
you plug it to the computer in a USB port	0
it conflicts with the A/C infrared!!! so funny	0
when I use the A/C remote, it renders the mouse buttons unresponsive	0
but I've found a way to restore the mouse buttons	0
by rebooting the USB ports :(	0
it works	0
・゜゜・。。・゜ ​ ゜\_ö​< FLAP FL​AP!	0
.bang	0
gasconheart you shot a duck in 3.263 seconds! You have killed 666 ducks in #romanian.	0
yess	0
the number of the beast!	0
I don't like befriending ducks	0
I will befriend them for a while I guess	0
oh I see	0
one fix you can try, gasconheart 	0
put an opaque tube over the end of the A/C remote so that light only goes forward and does not leak out the sides	0
like the tube around an ethernet cable	0
that's with the assumption that the interference is actually being caused by the infrared light itself	0
it could also be some internal conflict with the USB devices going on in the computer	0
a physical hack	0
that might work, but I was looking for a way to accomplish that through software	0
the A/C's remote infrared is what triggers the conflict, I'm taking that as the cause of the situation	0
・゜ ​ ゜・。。・゜゜\​_0< F​LAP FLAP!	0

handyc you befriended a duck in 114.564 seconds! You have made friends with 493 ducks in #romanian.	0
I always begin with the simplest possible solution	0
elegance can come later	0
otherwise you might spend 10 years trying to decompile a device driver and never end up fixing your problem	0
I belong to the school of "if it's stupid and it works, it's not stupid"	0
cool	0
another simple fix	0
ask yourself this	0
how often do you really need to adjust the settings on the A/C	0
does it have controls on the unit itself	0
would it be possible to get up from your chair and adjust the settings for the A/C on the unit itself, and avoid using the remote entirely	0
seems like if you find a temperature you like, there's no much need to keep messing with a remote	0
the A/C is too high up	0
but the only controls available are through the remote	0
even if I don't modify the temperature, turning it on or off messes with my laptop's infrared	0
oh I see	0
well if you plan to have this unit a long time,,	0
you could buy a piece of optical fiber and use it as a wave guide	0
then it wouldn't be as much like a remote anymore	0
but it would stop the interference because the light would be trapped in the wave guide	0

hi loudercake 	0
Hi handyc	0
how's life loudercake 	0
gasconheart: you didn't get it	0
your A/C controller is sending a right mouse down event to the computer	0
and never up	0
or maybe that thing has some sort of a lock idk	0
but if it is a mouse down that never gets up, you bind like 10 seconds of holding it to restart itself	0
Good	0

we are not talking about westworld per se, we are not giving spoilers, we are going to talk about the themes that are also present in the show	0
loudercake how do you like the show so far	0
also, you dont want spoiler but you dont watch it either... hmmm	0
great	0
loudercake thinks language is boring but westworld is great	0
how	0
how do you play stuff on the show? like songs? do you need to have them downloaded?	0
or does it work simply with youtube or something	0
hi, feral boys anx feral men	0
i am kn the streets now	0
primal	0
i am primal	0
you grew up on da streets gasconheart	0
no	0
btw why do romanians have the stealing stereotype?	0
hahaaaa	0
because gypsies	0
same in Spain	0
which 'migrated' from romania and bulgary to western cities to beg and steal	0
cause we have a minority here or gypsies	0
which wasnt so minor back then	0
white Romanians steal just as much :)	0
do they really?	0
i think poor people in general steal	0
yes	0
the majority of white Romanians are poor	0
but gypsies are even poorer, and mostly gypsies went abroad to steal, didnt they? i think its the same for bulgarians	0
i'm not trying to perpetuate the stereotype, but...	0
i do know some pretty cool gypsies and i had a lot of friends from that group	0
but i think most are pretty nasty people	0
I don't think they like to be called gypsies	0
Gypsies sounds like a slur	0
it's related to the word Egypt	0
Gonna go on a limb and guess it is	0
but they say they didn't come from Egypt	0
Some people say they are from Punjab	0
India?	0
yeah	0
Thats interesting	0
So they are like refugees	0
I don't think anyone really knows what they are	0
the Roma people, i think they call themselves	0
yes	0
linguistkcs helped pinpoint the exact year and location of their orivinL jomeland	0
apparently a lot of that stuff has recently been verified through genetic analysis	0
with amazlng accuracy, so i,ve read	0
I do not know much about the Roma language but I have heard there is a close connection to Sanskrit	0
i can bring you 10 guys that know roma, and a girl, but she hates her culture	0

(loudercake) No [more] results found.	0
a girl with a slight opposition to roma culture, I would call a faint aroma	0

I forgot to mention this to you	0
because I was trying not to give spoilers for the show	0
but here is a conversation I had with my wife on the general topic of simulated worlds	0
the question is how would you react upon realizing that you are definitely in a simulation of reality and not in "actual" reality	0
Minran did not really see it as a big deal	0
If the simulation were large enough maybe it does not make much difference	0
for example if it could be the size of the entire planet down to the atomic level	0
but I think problems would start to appear pretty quickly	0

then you just add them as children of this tabcontainer	0

well thats seems easy enough	0
well there is also the aspect of having to have messages be in the respective buffers	0
loudercake: the privmsg event has a channel	0
you create a dict of channel: BufferScene	0
buffers[ev.channel].add_message(ev.nick, ev.message)	0
in main.gd	0
and a BufferScene is a new scene with a script (pls attach scripts on the root control node), with that method to add_message chat adds  a richtext label with the text.	0
then in main.gd on client.JOIN event you: if getnick(ev.source) == nick: buffers[ev.channel] = BufferScene.instance()	0
and add the buffer[ev.channel] as a children of the tabbed container	0
and on PART you remove it from the tabbed container, i think just queue_free it, and remove from the dict with: buffers.erase(ev.channel)	0
got it loudercake ?	0

Mathematics has influenced the form and the terminology of the science, and has sometimes been useful in analysis; but mathematical methods of reasoning, in their application to economics, while possessing a certain fascination, are of very doubtful utility.	0
The analysis of the Hong Kong flora indicates that about threefifths of the species are common to the Indian region, and nearly all the remainder are either Chinese or local forms. The number of species common to southern China, Japan and northern Asia is small.	0
Between them the general theory of the complex variable, and of the various "infinite" processes of mathematical analysis, was established, while other mathematicians, such as Poncelet, Steiner, Lobatschewsky and von Staudt, were founding modern geometry, and Gauss inaugurated the differential geometry of surfaces.	0

The 18th century witnessed a rapid development of analysis, and the period culminated with the genius of Lagrange and Laplace.	0
All these views have, however, been cast in the shade by more recent investigations based on minute literary analysis of the Pentateuch, begun by Graf, continued by Kuenen, and culminating in the work of Wellhausen and Robertson Smith.	0

So also any exhaustive survey of the temperature and salinity of the sea at a great number of points on and below the surface reveals a complexity of conditions that may defy mathematical analysis and could not easily be predicted.	0
At present, however, the methods of analysis usually employed are not sufficiently delicate to afford all the necessary information as to the intrinsic value of the higher grades of rubber, and do not go much beyond the exclusion of inferior rubber.	0
Arithmetical groups, connected with the theory of quadratic forms and other branches of the theory of numbers, which are termed "discontinuous," and infinite groups connected with differential forms and equations, came into existence, and also particular linear and higher transformations connected with analysis and geometry.	0
It was also a distributory tax (impot de repartition); every year the king in his council fixed the total sum which the taille was to produce in the following year; he drew up and signed the brevet de la taille (warrant), and the contribution of the individual taxpayer was arrived at in the last analysis by a series of subdivisions.	0
Notable service was also rendered by Augustus de Morgan, who applied logical analysis to the laws of mathematics.	0
